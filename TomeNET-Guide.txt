(0) Quickstart
==============

(0.1) Start & play
------------------
If you are using Linux, you will find additional information about how to
compile the game under '(2.1) Installing/updating TomeNET'.

-Get the latest client from the project's main official site www.tomenet.eu.
 or from  http://muuttuja.org/tomenet/ (Mikael's site, which features a
 monster-search and other stuff).
 If you're on Microsoft Windows, it is recommended to get the installer package
 instead of the zip archives.

-Either double-click 'TomeNET-direct.bat' to directly connect to official main
 server (recommended), or run TomeNET.exe and choose a server manually, for
 example enter 37.187.75.24 to connect to the official main server.
 NOTE: The official main server's hostname is "europe.tomenet.eu".
 (The Bat-file will always work properly, even if there are DNS problems which
 cause the server list not to show up properly.)

-Create a character, Half-Troll warrior is good for beginners.
 The server should now allow you to manually choose your stats.
 In case you chose a (Half-Troll) warrior, try this:
  STR _at least_ 18/30 (to get a high number of attacks per round - the game
  client will even suggest 18/40 for minimum STR),
  CON as high as possible, INT as low as possible,
  spare points into DEX (especially!), WIS or CHR.
 If you decided to play a paladin make sure you have at least DEX 10.
  In case you can't reach STR 18/30, go for STR 18/20 instead, which should
  give you 2 attacks with a war hammer, your starting weapon. Then increase
  CON and WIS as high as possible, INT as low as possible, spare points (you
  shouldn't have any ;)) into CHR. (Paladins use WIS for casting spells.)
  If for some reason you can't even reach STR 18/20, at least go for STR 18/10,
  again DEX not below 10, then right after spawning in town discard the war
  hammer you start with and instead go buy a whip from store '3' (weapon store)
  or '4' (temple). This should give you a solid 2 attacks per round.
 If you decided to create a rogue, ensure that you have at least a STR of 15,
  and a pretty high DEX (the rogue's main stat) of 18/10. This will give you
  3 attacks per round when dual-wielding your light starter weapons.
  Rest goes into CON or INT (rogue's main stat for spell-casting).
 If you made a druid, put couple of points into all, DEX, STR and CON, and keep
  your WIS relatively high since it's important for druidic spell-casting.
  Some druids might value high starting WIS more than any of the other stats
  for that reason.
 Explanation:
   CON affects your hit points, more CON -> more HP.
   STR (and DEX) determine your number of attacks per round. 18/30 in STR is
   enough for warriors to get 3 attacks per round with very light weapons
   (daggers or whips) regardless of how you modify your DEX.
   To get the 3 blows per round (bpr) you'll need to sell your heavy sword and
   buy a light weapon (3.0 lb or less) like a dagger or whip. That is more
   efficient than 1 or 2 bpr with your original sword! Later on when your
   character becomes more powerful you can switch back to heavier weaponry.
   Warriors don't really need INT so you should reduce it to spend the points
   on other attributes. WIS isn't really needed either, but it can be useful
   to endure sanity-reducing effects and increase your saving throw against
   certain detrimental effects.
 Details about how STR and DEX affect startup blows/round are given in (6.5a).)


 ---- PLEASE NOTE: ----
 If you are new to the game, it is NOT recommended to choose one of these:
 Istar, Priest, Shaman, Adventurer, Runemaster.
 The reason is that these classes are hard to play in the beginning -
 compare introductory explanation in (6.5)!
 Recommended for new players are:
 Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Druid and maybe Archer.


-Make sure you DO NOT chose 'PvP' mode. It's a restricted special thing that
 has nothing to do with the normal gameplay at all! (See (6.13) for info).

-It's strongly recommended to not choose 'fruit bat' body either :).

 Now you're in the game and should see the town of Bree.

-To chat, press the colon key ':' . Don't hesitate to ask other players
 if you have any problems with getting started.
 (For details about chat features see (3.3).)

-To run, press SHIFT + <direction key> where direction keys are on
 the number pad 7,8,9, 4,6, 1,2,3. Running often requires that
 Numlock is turned off (press the 'Num' key above your number key pad on the
 right side of your keyboard, so the green light is off).
 If SHIFT+<direction> doesn't work on your system, you can press the dot '.'
 followed by a direction key. (If you use rogue-like keys, see section (0.2)!)
 You can also use the arrow keys to move, but the numpad is better since it
 allows you to move diagonally too, which is very important.

-You can wear/wield your armour/weapons by pressing 'w' and choosing them
 from your inventory which is displayed in the bottom right window.
 To take off an equipped item, press 't'. The item will be returned to your
 backpack (aka your inventory).

-You can pick up items if you stand on them and press 'g'. Items that are
 especially valuable in the beginning are magic wands and staves, so make sure
 to pick those up, identify them with a scroll of identify, and sell them to
 the magic shop in town.

-You can drop items with 'd' or destroy items with 'k'.

-You can enter stairs down/upwards by standing on them and pressing the
 corresponding key '<' or '>'.

-You can press '?' to get a short in-game help. The actual list of commands
 and further info are contained in this guide.

-Nearby the starter town (Bree) there's often a 'training tower' which is a
 good place to start because if you die there nothing will happen except a
 slight loss of experience and gold. Ask people where the dark-green '<' symbol
 (the tower entrance) is found. Usually to the lower-right of the town centre.

-If you die outside of the training tower you will usually turn into a ghost.
 This ghost cant wear any items, so it's a good idea to care about being
 revived. To get revived, either visit the temple in town (it's a green '4')
 or ask another player to read a 'Scroll of Life' while standing next to you.
 While you're a ghost you can freely float up/down by pressing '<' and '>'.

-If you have any parchments like 'Guide to Middle Earth' or 'The Gazette' in
 your inventory (bottom right window) you can read those by pressing 'r' to
 read. They don't do anything, just a short read containing some information.

-If your character gains a new level it also gains skill points. To distribute
 those, invoke the skill screen with SHIFT+G. (See (3.10), (6.2) and (7.5).)

-If you don't like your character and want to delete it, you may commit
 suicide by pressing SHIFT+q or CTRL+k and double-confirming the following
 questions with 'y' and '@'.

-To drop items, privately chat with other players, or advance beyond a certain
 level you will need an admin to 'validate' your account.
 Usually, all you have to do is to keep playing/stay online for a bit until an
 admin logs in, notices that you are new, and validates your account.
 If that doesn't seem to happen, just ask in chat openly. Some players have
 validation privileges too and can help you out.

-Press '@' key to see a list of players who're currently online.

 A yellow '(I)' before a name stands for 'invalid', and means that this player
 is still awaiting account validation by an admin.
 A grey '(O)' is in front of a player name, it means that player is using an
 outdated client. It's very important to keep your client up to date!

 If another player's character level is displayed in light blue colour, that
 means he is within sensible level range of you to form a party! Press SHIFT+P
 for party menu. One of you has to create the party and add the other one.

 A name displayed in dark blue is an admin.
 A name displayed in purple is a 'winner', ie a player who managed to beat the
 game boss, Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness (and hasn't died since).
 A name displayed in red is a ghost, ie a player who died. :(
 A name displayed in dark grey is a player who is currently inside the special
 'Ironman Deep Dive Challenge' dungeon.

-A few other important keys are:
 ~  knowledge menu (all of your character's knowledge, plus artifact/monster
    spoilers under ~6 and ~7 respectively.)
 =  game options menu.
 %  macro menu ('macros' are hotkeys, allowing you to bind certain actions to a
    single key press). (More about macros in (3.6) up to (3.9b).)
 SHIFT+P  form a party with your buddies. You share experience in a party and
          you can always see each other on the map and your team mates' current
          world location in the player list (accessed with '@' key).
 SHIFT+L  look around the map. Very useful to locate team mates ;).
 CTRL+U  the audio mixer menu (the hotkeys for toggling master/music work
         outside of this menu too).
 CTRL+Q  quit the game. Safest way is to quit in a town, not in the dungeon!


-Note that your character's "speed" may change. Speed is the factor telling you
 how fast your character can move, fight or perform any other kind of action.
 If your character's speed gets increased (for example by drinking a potion of
 speed) you will see a green indicator (for example 'Fast +10') at the bottom
 line of the main window.
 If your character loses speed, for example by carrying around too many heavy
 items in your inventory, you will see a light brown indicator (for example
 'Slow -3') at the bottom line instead.

You could continue reading at (3.2) now, which explains the user interface,
or glance at (7.1), (7.2) or (7.3) first which explain some basic strategy.



(0.2) Command reference & key sets
----------------------------------
Can be different depending on OS / configuration.
This chapter consists of three subsections:
Command keys, Text editing keys, Slash commands.


Command keys
------------

Key combinations with CTRL key can be entered in the macro menu by prefixing
the key with a '^' symbol. For example, a swap-macro in normal key set could be
'x0', but in rogue-like key set (where swap is CTRL+A instead of x) it will be
'^a0' instead (or with capital letter: '^A0', it's all the same for ^ codes).

Keys:
The first key is of the 'original Angband key set', the second key is of the
'rogue-like' key set. Some people prefer to use that one. You can change it
in the options menu, which you invoke with '=' key.


Walk into a direction:
    Original key set        Rogue-like key set      Rogue-like (running)
        7   8   9               y   k   u               Y   K   U
        4       6               h       l               H       L
        1   2   3               b   j   n               B   J   N

You can also use the arrow keys instead of the Numpad keys for movement.
(Pressing '5' will make your character try and pick up an item, same as
pressing 'g').

SHIFT+<direction key>
        runs into that direction. Numlock must probably be turned off,
        depending on your system. (Numlock is the key labeled 'Num' above the
        number key pad on the right side of your keyboard. A green lamp
        usually indicates whether it is on or off.)
        You can also run by pressing the dot '.' followed by a direction key.

.       .       Allows you to run (same as SHIFT+direction key).

;       ;       The 'walk' command, it allows you to walk one step. This is not
                really needed for anything usually, since you can just press
                the directional keys given above instead for walking.

i       i       display your inventory. You can then press SHIFT + inventory
                slot letter to paste that item name into chat.
                You can also type \\<slot letter> shortcut in chat to paste an
                item right into some text you are writing, eg "\\a" for the
                item in your inventory slot 'a)'.

e       e       display your equipment. You can then press SHIFT + equipment
                slot letter to paste that item name into chat.
                You can also type \\<capital slot letter> shortcut in chat to
                paste an item right into some text you are writing, eg "\\A"
                for the item in your equipment slot 'a)'.

I       I       inspects an item, showing its special abilities in case it
                has some. To examine an item you must either have bought it
                from a shop or *identified* it. Mages can learn *ID* spell
                "Greater Identify", some shops offer *ID* service, or you can
                use a scroll of *identify*. If the item hasn't been
                *identified* yet, you will only see basic information.
                See (5.7) for more information about ID, *ID* and shops!
                If you examine weapons, it always tells you the weapon class
                (sword/blunt/axe/polearm) as well as if it's 1-, 2- or
                1,5-handed.

w       w       wear/wield an item from your inventory (weapons, rings,
                amulets, light sources, armour, ammunition, tools).

W       CTRL+W  wear/wield an item, same as 'w', but tries to use the second
                available slot in case two inventory slots are both egligible.

t       T       take off an item.

x       CTRL+A  swap an item. This is basically like both "wear/wield" and
                "take off" in one command. This makes only sense if it is used
                with an item that has been _inscribed_ accordingly, for example
                "@x4":
                When the item is currently in the inventory, it will be
                equipped. If it already is equipped though, then it will be
                taken off.

q       q       quaff a potion.

r       r       read a scroll.

E       E       eat food. Hunger can kill you, if you don't eat for a longer
                while, depending on your character. You will see a yellow
                'Hungry' appear below the status bar on the left side in the
                main window, then it will change gradually to orange/red 'Weak'
                and you will start getting paralysed by the lack of food!
                Finally you will start losing hit points and eventually die
                from starvation.
                (Draconians can eat firestones to gain temporary special
                abilities, see (5.9). Players in dragon form can eat them too.)

F       F       fuel your light source.
                Use oil for lanterns, and torches to fuel another torch.

f       t       fire ammo from your quiver.

v       v       throw an item from your inventory.

b       P       browse (peruse) a book.

m       m       activate a skill (ie cast a magic spell, lay a trap, use an
                ability, use a technique, polymorph into a monster form or
                back to normal, cast a monster-spell while polymorphed,
                enter a combat stance).

g       g       pick up an item from the floor. You have to stand on the item
                to do that. You can also pick up an item by pressing '5' on
                the number pad while numlock is turned off. Gold is always
                picked up automatically.

                item will be picked.
                Note that ',' key has by default a "reply to last private chat"
                macro on it, so you'll have to use 'g' key instead or delete
                the macro from the comma key, if you want to use it to pick up
                items.

CTRL+G  CTRL+Z  pick up exactly one piece from a stack of same type of items.

K       CTRL+C  forcibly combines a level 0 item in your inventory with other
                items of the same type that aren't level 0. Be warned, that
                this will change the level of all the items involved to 0.

C       C       see a character overview.

L       W       look around your current sector/floor (use direction keys).

M       M       display either the world map if you're not in a town or in a
                dungeon, otherwise display a minimap of the town or of your
                currentl dungeon level.
                If you want to see the world map while you're in town or in
                the dungeon, press ~ and choose "Wilderness map" there.
                You can scroll around the map via directional keys.

s       s       search adjacent fields, objects or walls for hidden traps or
                doors.

S       #       enter 'search mode'. You will search your adjacent fields once
                each turn. If you stand next to a room and you want to find
                its hidden door, turn this on and run along its walls until
                you find it.

V       V       enter 'cloaking mode'. This can only be used by rogues.
                It will take a couple of turns to perfectly cloak your
                physical appearance and body warmth pattern, after which you
                will be completely invisible to monsters who use normal sight
                or infra-vision.
                Only a few monsters who are able to utilize ESP (telepathy) or
                have especially powerful detection will still notice you.
                Those are eyes, angels, Nazgul, nether guards, and unique
                monsters which are both smart and powerful at once.
                Taking damage (HP/sanity/experience), attacking, and some other
                actions will immediately break cloaking, while some actions
                such as drinking a potion will only temporarily weaken your
                cloaking: Your colour will go from dark grey to normal grey for
                a short time, during which you are not effectively cloaked. If
                you avoid taking damage or performing any action that breaks
                cloaking during this time, you will go back to being perfectly
                cloaked.
                The duration of cloaking being weakened will vary depending on
                which action you performed.
                Auto-retaliation is disabled while cloaked, except for the
                Stormbringer (which will break the effect of course).
                Taking damage from floor terrain will not affect cloaking.
                Cloaking will also increase your searching, greatly increase
                your stealth, but decrease your speed. Sneakiness skill may
                very slightly reduce the decrease.
                If you attack a monster while cloaked, it'll count as backstab,
                making full use of your 'Backstabbing' skill if you have
                trained it. See (6.2) for 'Backstabbing' details!
                Note: Cloaking has no effect on shoplifting; it breaks on
                entering any shop.
                Note: Although ESP is supposed to detect cloaked targets, for
                now it's still set to override ESP of other players for the
                sake of PvP usage, similar to invisibility.
                (Also see (5.16) for details on 'normal' invisibility.)

A       A       activate an item. Usually an artifact, a dragon scale mail or
                a ring of polymorphing (shapechanging).

T or +  +       tunnel (dig) through an obstacle or a wall.

R       R       rest. Your hit points, mana and stamina will regenerate faster
                while resting.

o       o       open something.

c       c       close something.
c   while in a store:
                Paste an item name, its price and the store symbol into chat,
                in case you want to tell other players about it.
                You can also type \\\<slot letter> shortcut in chat to paste an
                item right into some text you are writing, eg "\\\a" for the
                first item on the store page you are currently looking at.

d       d       drop an item.

$       $       drop some gold. You can use 'k' and 'm' for thousands or
                millions, example: 3k -> drops 3000. 2m -> drops 2000000.
                You can also do things like 2m43 to drop 2430000 gold pieces or
                k6 to drop 600.

D       D       disarm a trap. This yields experience points, depending on the
                trap type. (Note that you won't get experience points for
                disarming traps via magic spells or magic devices.)
                Also see (4.7) for details about traps.

k       CTRL+D  destroy an item. (Note that artifacts cannot be destroyed this
                way.)

G       G       skills screen.

B       f       bash/force something (ie a stuck door).
                If the door crashes open, it softens the sleep of nearby asleep
                monsters somewhat (similar in effect to the /cough command).

l       x       look at a player/monster/object (use direction keys for
                targetting). Similar to targetting, while looking you can press
                'p' to switch to manual cursor positioning, allowing you to
                look at a specific grid, then press 'l' again to confirm.
                (Unimportant side note: The look command also sets the entity
                you are currently looking at as your target, even if it would
                not make much sense because you are for example just looking at
                another player who isn't even hostile towards you.
                This means that you will aim at the entity you looked at in
                case the '*t' command is unable to acquire a new valid 'real'
                target when you use a ranged attack that requires a target.
                This behaviour has no real effect on gameplay though it just
                looks odd in those rare cases it happens :-p.)

j       S       attempt to steal from players (not recommended!).

U       O       use undead powers (use this if you died and became a ghost).
                Using these will drain your experience. If you ran out of
                experience points, your ghost fades away (= you character will
                be completely erased).
                NOTE: Undead powers are currently not available.

CTRL+S          spike a door (using iron spikes, the door will be jammed).

p       p       Concentrate on opening your mind for telekinesis.
                ("You open your mind.." and "You close your mind.")
                You need to open your mind in order to receive items from
                other players by telekinesis. If you are not concentrating,
                they will receive an according message, telling them that
                using telekinesis on you is currently not possible.
                Hit 'p' again to stop concentrating and close your mind.
                Certain spells of the mindcrafter class might also require
                players in the same party to open their minds in order to work
                or to affect them as intended.
                Having an open mind can make it easier for psi/confuse effects
                to affect you.

h       CTRL+E  sell/buy a house or change house parameters. See (4.10).

P       O       party screen. Form/disband/modify a party with other players
                here. In a party you will share experience points if you are
                within 7 character levels to each other and on the same
                dungeon/tower level respectively the same worldmap/wilderness
                sector. See (6.9) for details!
                For winners (queens/kings/empresses/emperors) the range is 11
                levels instead of 7.

H       CTRL+G  re-apply client-side and (if 'auto_inscribe' option is enabled)
                server-side auto-inscriptions to an item.

CTRL+U  CTRL+F  Displays/exits the audio mixer settings. (Also see (2.1a).)
                Note: Mixer settings are saved automatically, provided you use
                CTRL+Q to quit.
                (Compare troubleshooting section (8.8), problem 21.)

                Here you can set audio volume for sound effects and music or
                mute them separately. The hotkeys for muting work outside of
                the mixer screen too, during normal gameplay.

                If you haven't installed a sound or music pack, you can do
                that by running the TomeNET-Updater or by downloading packs
                manually (for download links see the 'download' page on the
                TomeNET homepage for official packs, or look in the forum for
                user-made packs).

CTRL+C  CTRL+X  Toggles music. Shortcut for toggling it in the mixer settings.
                This hotkey works outside of the mixer screen too.

CTRL+N  CTRL+V  Toggles audio. Shortcut for master toggle in the mixer
                settings. This hotkey works outside of the mixer screen too.

                Note: If you press this while in chat prompt, you will instead
                cycle forwards through lines you previously typed - also see
                CTRL+P key, which cycles backwards.


SPACE   Stop executing repeatable actions such as searching, tunnelling or
        disarming traps. Also stops active fire-till-kill shooting and any
        preparations for a shooting technique (flare missile, precision shot,
        barrage).

< or >  go upstairs/downstairs. Press '>' to use a void gate (violet '+').
        Void jump gates teleport you to their counterpart and vice versa giving
        you a message "You fall into the void. Brrrr! It's deadly cold.".
        Draconians can get harmed by using void jump gates, see (6.4).
        If you take staircases up/down, you'll receive the 'stair GoI' buff,
        see (0.4) for details on that.

{       inscribe an item.

        If the first character is a backslash '\', then instead of overwriting
        an existing inscription the new inscription will either replace a part
        of the current one or otherwise be appended at its end.
        Replacing happens if the backslash is followed by either @<letter> or !
        or # which indicate special inscription "parts".
        Examples:
        An inscription "abc !k @S- xyz" that is inscribed "\@S50k" will turn
        out "abc !k @S50k xyz". If it is instead inscribed "\!ds" then it will
        turn out "abc !ds @S- xyz".
        When replacing the # part or an @P part, the whole rest of the
        inscription is replaced. For @P this is so because player names may
        contain spaces, so those cannot be used as reliable delimiters.

        Instead of replacing a tag, you can also remove it by doubling the tag
        type character, examples:
        "\@@S" will remove the price tag from an item.
        "\@@" will remove the first @-tag of any type.
        "\!!" will remove an "!" tag.
        "\##" will remove the whole part that follows after the '#' character.

        To simply append a new inscription to an existing inscription, enter
        '\\' at the beginning of the new inscription.

}       remove inscription from an item.

/       in general, use an item (combines q,r, etc..).
        This can be useful if you run out of macros for a specific action,
        for example if you already use @m0...@m9 and still have more spell
        books/scrolls in your inventory, you can inscribe the remaining ones
        @/0...@/9. Or you could create a macro *t/0- and bind it to a certain
        key, and then inscribe a useful wand or staff @/0 without having to pay
        attention to whether you're currently using a wand or staff there (or
        rod, of course), as a sort of 'special power button', for example a
        staff of slow monsters (very handy at low levels) or a wand of light
        to kill orcs, jellies, and other light-sensitive critters.
        Note that in the spell book example above, you could of course just use
        call-by-name instead so you won't need any inscriptions at all (3.9b) !

~       display further information of your (character's) knowledge.
        Point (2) and (7) here are especially helpful for mimics:
        In ~2, the number shown in round brackets before each monster name is
        the same they have to enter for their 'Polymorph self into..' ability!
        In ~7 you can check out all features of a monster.

@       displays a list of players currently on the server.
        Note that a yellow '(I)' before a name stands for 'invalid', and means
        that this player is still awaiting account validation by an admin.
        Also, if a grey '(O)' is in front of a player name, it means that
        player is using an outdated client. It's very important to keep your
        client up to date! (Same command as ~a)
        If another player's character level is displayed in light blue colour,
        that means he is within sensible level range of you to form a party!
        Press SHIFT+P for party menu. One of you has to create the party and
        add the other one.

        Additional info that may be shown in @ screen:
        'Silent mode'   Means the player has enabled the 'limit_chat' option,
                        which restricts chat to players on the same dungeon
                        floor as him, except for private/party/guild messages.
        'Private mode'  The player has used the '/ic' command to ignore all
                        chat except for private or party messages.
        '*Private* mode'
                        The player has used the '/ic *' (or alias /dnd) command
                        to ignore all chat except for party messages and
                        private messages from party members.

        If the server has specific PK-rules enabled, there are additionally:
        'PK'            Player participates in player-killing.
        'SAFE'          Player does not participate in player-killing.
        'Newbie'        Player cannot participate in player-killing.
        'Killable'      Player can get killed by other players.
        To modify the PK status of your character, use the '/pkill' command.
        Note: These PK-rules are disabled by default on our official server.

        User Interface Options:
            "Rogue-like commands" will change your keyboard layout to
                the original Rogue key definitions.
            "Flicker messages in recall" will allow you to see animated
                messages in the bottom left window (message history).
            "Always show lists in item/skill selection" will always show a
                list of possible choices if you use commands that require you
                to make a selection from a list of choices.
            A lot of audio options; note that on systems where the /page
            command won't produce a native beep sound, you can enable sound
            system paging instead here! (Of course you can also enable it on
            all other systems too, which might be nicer than the system beep).
        Game-Play Options:
            "Set 'AFK' mode automatically" will set you afk after some
                minutes of inactivity.
            "Automatically open doors" makes your character try to open a door
                just by moving towards it.
            "Automatically disarm traps" makes your character try to disarm a
                trap just by stepping onto it.
            "Automatically tunnel walls" makes your character tunnel through a
                wall just by moving towards it.
            "Scroll the screen more frequently" helps to avoid death by
                attacks that came from off-screen. However, this option can be
                a bit irritating.

:       type a chat message. To whisper privately, enter <player>:<text>
        eg:  Gandalf:hi!  - actually the first few letters of the target
        player's name are enough, like:  Gan:hi!
        You can also enter a slash command here.
        Press TAB to cycle between different chat modes, such as party-chat.
        For details about chat features see (3.3).
        For details about slash commands, see further below in this paragraph.
        There is also a /say command for talking to players nearby, and a
        /shout command for waking up monsters! See further below.

'       lets you peek at the equipment of party members or players within
        sight.

#       displays the high scores (same as ~c).
        (Note: If you press this while browsing any text you can jump to a
        line number of your choice.)

|       displays the unique monster list (same as ~1).

X       this key carries a predefined macro:
        Quickly swap between two equippable items. They must be inscribed
        '@x0'. (It's basically just the macro 'x0' bound to shift+x key.)
        You can remove this macro in the macro menu, just like any other macro,
        if you don't like it.

,       This key carries a predefined macro:
        Reply to the last private message you received. It's simply the macro
        ':+:' bound to a key.
        You can remove this macro in the macro menu, just like any other macro,
        if you don't like it.

_       Two uses, regarding a) fountains or b) item piles:

        a) Main: Drink from a fountain. You must be standing on the fountain.
        Fountains can have good/bad/no effects. There is no fountain of death,
        neither one of detonations, so you won't get instakilled.
        If you see a message 'You feel less thirsty' that means the fountain
        was just plain water. A message 'You have quenched your thirst' means
        that the fountain had no effect on you, although it wasn't water.
        (Same as /sip command.)
        Fountains cannot have effects of potions which are of higher level than
        the dungeon level where the fountain is. The duration of the effect is
        also the same as the actual potion would last.

        b) Secondary: If you press _ while standing on an item or a pile of
        items, you will get a message what item is currently below your feet.

?       invoke an in-game help screen

!       look at the in-game bulletin board. Players can write lines of text to
        it by using the /bbs <text> command.

CTRL+P  view previous messages.
        Note: You can also press this when in chat prompt, to cycle backward
        through lines that you previously typed (also see CTRL+N, which cycles
        forwards).

CTRL+O  view previous chat messages.

CTRL+Q  save your character & quit the game. (You should do this in town!)
        This also automatically saves some settings, like window layout (the
        windows' positions and sizes) and mixer settings (CTRL+U to change,
        CTRL+F on rogue-like key map), and you will be asked if you want to
        save the chat log to a text file.
        Note that if you exit the game just by clicking on the 'x' button in
        the game window's titlebar, these extra features will be skipped, and
        any changes in settings or window layout will be discarded.

Q or CTRL+K
        lets your character commit suicide (permanently deletes it!).
        Characters who suicide won't drop items except for artifacts (if the
        server has ANTI_ARTS_HOARD enabled then no item at all will be
        dropped), nor will they keep the level static as it happens on a
        normal 'final death' (see (3.11) for details about static levels).

CTRL+R  redraw the screen (do this if it's messed up for some reason).
 (/refresh, /ref)

CTRL+T  take a screen shot. See /screenshot command below.

------------------------
When typing in a line of text (eg to chat), the following control keys are
available for text editing:

CTRL+P/N    Cycle through your message history.

CTRL+V/B    Move cursor to beginning/end of line.

CTRL+Q/W    Move cursor back/forward by one word.
CTRL+E      Delete word before the cursor.
    ..and a special function:
    Whenever a text input prompt appears which suggests a default text, you may
    press CTRL+E as the first key you hit. Then the default text will actually
    be used as if you entered it and it becomes editable.
    The main purpose of this functionality is in the macro menu when manually
    editing macro actions: You can edit a previously defined action without
    having to completely retype it.

CTRL+A/S    Move cursor back/forward by one character.
CTRL+D      Delete character under the cursor.


(0.2b) Slash commands
---------------------
There are also some commands that can be entered with ':' like a chat line.
They all start with a slash '/' hence they're called slash commands:

/help       view a list of all command keys (same as pressing '?' key).
            Also lists a few most commonly used slash commands.

/afk        toggle AFK (away from keyboard) mode if you have to take a
            quick break from playing.
            Note that your character won't need to consume food while afk _IF_
            you are not already 'hungry' or even 'weak' from a lack of food!
            All other timed effects will continue to be processed (like
            magical effects such as haste/slowness/hallucination, pseudo-ID or
            wearing off of temporary stat drain from traps) and eventually
            wear off.
            Also, other players cannot switch places with you by moving into
            you, use teleportation or Word of Recall on you, infect you with
            black breath by bumping into you, steal from you, form a blood bond
            with you or attempt to polymorph you while you are afk.
            An exception are grids in front of stores: If you block those,
            other players can switch places with you even when you're afk.

/afk <msg>  You can specify a reason that will be displayed to the other
            players, so they know why you are currently AFK or when you will
            be back.

/autoret    Sets up auto-retaliation with a mimic power.
 (/ar)      Usage:   /ar [t]<power>   or to disable:   /ar -
            If 't' is prefixed to the power, it will only be used while in a
            town. Example:   /ar tg
            This will auto-retaliate with mimic power 'g)' while in town.

            (Note that you cannot auto-retaliate with 'polymorph into...'
            power aka 'c)', instead it will be treated like power 'b)' aka
            'polymorph into next form with fitting extremities'.)

/bed [*|<inscription>]
 (/naked)   Opposite of /dress.
            If no parameter is given, the character takes off everything from
            body slot to feet slot.
            If '*' is given as parameter, the character will take off all
            equipped items.
            If another parameter is given, the character will take off all
            items that have this parameter occur in their inscription.

/bbs <text>
            Add a line of text to the in-game bulletin board system. Players
            can look at the board by pressing the '!' key.
            (You can verify or compare the date with the /time command.)
            If <text> is omitted, the current BBS contents will be shown, same
            as using the '!' key.

/convertexclusive    Attempts to convert your current character into a
                     slot-exclusive character (either PvP-mode or IDDC aka
                     Ironman Deep Dive Challenge). Warning: This process is NOT
                     REVERSIBLE! To attempt to convert your character, type:
                     /convertexclusive <your-character-name>
                     for example:
                     /convertexclusive Gandalf
                     If you still have a free exclusive character slot
                     available then your character is moved to that slot,
                     freeing up a generic character slot again.

/coin       Flip a coin to get either heads or tails.
 or /flip   The result is random and can be seen by other players who stand
            nearby.

/shuffle [32|52 <jokers>]
            Prepares a new deck of cards.
            If you specify no arguments it will shuffle a deck of 52 cards
            without any jokers as default setting.
            Valid arguments are either 32 or 52 to pick a deck size. When you
            specifiy a deck size you may optionally specify an amount of jokers
            to be added to the deck, which may range from 0 (default) to 12.
/deal [<name>]
            Deals a random card from the player's current deck. (Use /shuffle
            to actually prepare a deck first.)
            The card dealt can be seen by other players who stand nearby.
            If you specify a player name the message will tell the others to
            whom you dealt that card.
            If it's the final card of the deck, everyone around will be
            notified of that fact.
/draw <name>
            Draws a random card from another player's deck. Basicall same as
            the /deal command, except for who actually picks the card (the
            dealer himself or one of the other participants).
            If it's the final card of the deck, everyone around will be
            notified of that fact.
/dealer <name>
            Hand over your current deck of cards to someone else. If that
            player already shuffled a deck of his own, that one will be erased
            aka overwritten by the one he receives from you.

/dice       Roll some dice, you must specify a number of dice from 1 to 100.
            The result is random and can be seen by other players who stand
            nearby.
/d          Rolls two dice, shortcut for "/dice 2".
/die        Rolls one dice, shortcut for "/dice 1".
/roll and /r are same as /dice and /d respectively.

/dis        DESTROYS every item in your inventory that has one of these
 (/dispose) inscriptions: terrible, cursed, uncursed, broken, worthless,
            average, good. Works only on items that actually can be destroyed.
            Skips 'flavoured' items that are not known to you yet (example:
            'a blue potion {+,?}' or 'a malachite ring {+,?}').
            Skips items which inscription contains more than a pseudo-ID tag.
            Also see /tag and /untag. Note that artifacts cannot be destroyed
            this way.
            As a specialty, /dis (without parameters) will also destroy cheap
            (leather/metal) shield types that do not posses any special powers.
            As another specialty, /dis (without parameters) will skip dragon
            scale mails, leaving them intact.

/dis a      DESTROYS items like '/dis', and additionally destroys all items
            that have no inscription at all.
            Also see /tag and /untag.

/dis b      DESTROYS items like '/dis a' does, but skips identified ego items,
            provided they aren't cursed.
            It also skips (non-cursed) exploding ammo, although it isn't really
            an ego item.

/dis f      DESTROYS the item on the floor you're standing on provided it is
            not inscribed in any way, and tells you about the next item below
            that.

/dis fa     DESTROYS an item like '/dis f', even if it has an inscription.

/dis fb     DESTROYS an item like '/dis fa', but skips identified ego items,
            provided they aren't cursed.
            It also skips (non-cursed) exploding ammo, although it isn't really
            an ego item.

/dis F[a|b] Same as '/dis f', also accepts optional parameters a or b, but this
            command destroys the whole ITEM PILE you're standing on.

/dr [tag]   Without tag it equips all items in your inventory that are: not
(/dress)    cursed, not {worthless}, not {broken}, not {terrible}, and that are
            known to you.
            With tag it just equips all items that contain that tag in their
            name or inscription somewhere (even if they are cursed).
            Opposite of /bed.

/dun        Displays the name of the dungeon you're currently in.

/empty <inventory slot>
            Empty a potion from your inventory, leaving an empty bottle.
            Example: /empty c   (if you have 'c) 3 potions of boldness', one
            will be emptied and 2 remain at 'c) 2 potions of boldness'.))

/evinfo     Displays information about all ongoing events.

/evinfo <#>
            Displays information about the specific event number #.
            Note: If you log out, your sign-up is cancelled automatically.

/evsign <#>
            Signs you up for the event number #.
            Depending on the event, you might need to specify additional
            parameters after the number. If that is the case, you'll see
            a message telling you so and about which details what's missing.
            NOTE: If you log out, your sign-up is cancelled automatically,
                  so after logging back in you will have to sign up again.
/evunsign <#>
            Signs you off from that event number #.

/ex or /examine or /extra
            Gives you detailed information about your character's status, such
            as how many actions you may perform per turn.

            A turn is a basic server timing unit, which for example is used to
            display the amount of fuel in your light source, or which will make
            you suffer poison damage each on each turn that passes if you're
            poisoned.
            Turns pass slower on deeper dungeon levels to make up for increased
            monster and player speed, keeping the game playable in real-time,
            see (4.14) for details.
            (Note that the server also has a type of internal turn counter,
            which counts a different sort of turns, one each frame. Usually,
            the server will run at 100 fps, so these turns pass much faster.
            It might be a bit confusing that both these units are just called
            'turns' although they don't correlate, but you won't really have to
            worry about internal turns at any point, only the 'character turns'
            are of any importance and noticable by your character, for example,
            as mentioned above, when you're poisoned, suffering from a cut,
            waiting for your blacklist to run out, or any other matters.)

            Additionally, /ex will also display the following information:
            - how many resurrections you have left, if you are a normal-mode
              character;
            - which of your auras are currently active (if you have points in
              the corresponding aura skills);
            - extremities your current monster form possesses (if you're
              transformed into a monster form at the moment). This can be
              helpful to figure out what types of items you may equip while in
              this form.
            - forms you have learned if you're a druid, and their according
              polymorph codes so you don't have to look them up in (6.7b) if
              you forgot them;
            - pvp kills;
            - the in-game time and date, and whether it is day or night.
              (Note: If you want to know the server real-life time, use /time.)
            - how much more gold you may pick up before your character will
              automatically receive 1 experience point (to limit the amount
              of cash you can pick up before participating in certain events,
              such as Highlander Tournament or Ironman Deep Dive Challenge).

/exit       Leaves the game, same as pressing CTRL+Q.
 (/leave,/quit)

/fe         Repeat the level feeling. See (4.8) for more information.
 (/feeling) If you aren't eligible for receiving a floor feeling, you will
            instead get the message "You feel nothing special.".

/fill       fill an 'Empty Bottle' in your inventory with the water from a
            fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.

/ftkon or /ftkoff
            Enables or disables fire-till-kill mode (see (5.2a)).
            Alternatively, you can toggle it in 'm' menu.

/gbbs <text>    Same usage as /bbs, but only readable/writable for guild
                members. So it's a guild-internal BBS.
                To read its contents, type /gbbs without any <text>.

/gleave     Leaves your guild. Same as pressing 'SHIFT+P' and 'd'.
 or /gquit

/gnote <text>
            Leave a note to the guild you own.
            If <text> is omitted, it will display the current note.
            If <text> is just an '*' char, it will erase the current note.

/guild_adder <name of another player>
            Allows that player permanently to add other players to the guild
            too. Use the command a second time to revoke his rights again.

/guild_cfg [<flag> [<value]]
            Shows you your current guild configuration and allows you to change
            it.

/guildmembers   Displays a list of all members of your guild.

/hou        Displays your houses, same as ~9, but offers two optional
 (/house)   parameters to refine the search results:
            /hou o    will only show your own houses.
            /hou l    will only show houses in your current worldmap sector.
            /hou ol   both of the above.

/ig <player name>
 (/ignore)  ignores all chat messages from the specified player. (Toggle)
            Also silences all paging attempts from that player.
            To un-mute the target again, retype the command with its name.
            The blocked player will see a message about you ignoring him when
            he tries to send you any private message or page you.

/ic         ignore all normal chat messages which are neither private messages
 (/ignchat) nor party messages. ('Private mode' will be displayed after
            the player's name in the player overview screen which can be
            invoked by pressing '@', indicating that this player currently
            cannot read normal chat messages.)
            (This is similar to 'limit_chat' option, which however still allows
            all floor-chat occurring on the same dungeon floor and guild chat.)
/ic *       Same as above, but also disables all private messages except from
 (/dnd)     party members! (Will display '*Private* mode' after the player's
            name in the @ screen.)

/info <msg>
            Sets an informative message that is displayed to other players in
            '@' screen, similar to an afk-message, except this message is
            displayed when you're not afk.
            For example do:  /info Want to team up for Mordor!
            If you type /info without a message, it clears your info message.

/kifu <email>
            Use this command after you played Go in the casino in Minas Anor.
            It will send all your new Go game records as SGF files to the email
            specified. If you're using a Microsoft-related email address, eg
            outlook.com, note that Microsoft is notorious for blocking email
            from the email-provider used by TomeNET, so you might not get it.
            The /kifu command works per character name, not per account name,
            so you only get those kifus emailed that the character played on
            which you used the command. (SGF is the 'Smart Game Format'.)

/leave      Leaves the game, same as pressing CTRL+Q.
 (/exit, /quit)

/lite a..w  Refills your light source with an item from your inventory.
            Usually it's easier to just press 'F' instead.

/mar        Tells a holy-defense-user if he may use the prayer 'Martyrdom'.
 (/martyr)

/me         Write an emote. Example: /me hides.

/mon <monster character>
            Same as going to ~ menu and selecting 'Monsters':
            Will show your kill count of all matching monsters.
            Example: /mon D  ->  shows your greater dragons kill count.

/motd       Shows the current server notes that are displayed at login.
 (/snotes)

/news       Shows the login screen, same as ~f, but in monochrome.

/note <character/account name>:<text>
            Leave a note to another player. The message will actually go to the
            player's account even if you specified a character name, so no
            matter which of his characters he chooses to logon, he always gets
            the note.
/note <character/account name>
            Delete all pending notes that were addressed to that player.
/notes      Display all pending notes that you wrote to other players.

/obj        Displays all objects known to you, same as ~4.
 (/object)

/page <player-name>     Sends beeps to that player to help you getting his
                        attention. (Using /ignore on a player will also
                        prevent getting paged by him.)
                        If you're on Linux and not hearing the page sounds,
                        see problem 19 in the troubleshooting section (8.8).

/paint      (Also available by pressing 'h' for house menu.)
            Use a potion in your inventory to paint your house entrance in a
            similar colour. The potion is used up in the process. A potion of
            water removes the paint again.
            Painting your house can be useful for example to mark it for others
            to see that you run a player store. Further, you could choose the
            colour to indicate the type of items you offer, for example red
            for magic items similar to the red '6' town store.
            Note that players of incompatible character mode (everlasting vs
            non-everlasting) won't see each other's house paint.
            (See (4.10a) for more information about player stores.)

/partymembers   Displays a list of all members of your party.

/pbbs <text>    Same usage as /bbs, but only readable/writable for party
                members. So it's a party-internal BBS.
                To read its contents, type /pbbs without any <text>.

/pkill      Toggles the player's status regarding participation in 'PK' actions
 or /pk     aka player-killing. PK rules must be enabled on the server in order
            to use this command. The PK status of each player will be displayed
            in the players-online-screen that you invoke by pressing @ key.
            Note: PK-rules are disabled by default on our official server.

/play       Join/leave a mini-game (such as rugby on the field in Bree).
            Will at some point in the future be absorbed by /evsign and
            thereby become obsolete.

/pleave     Leaves your party. Same as pressing 'SHIFT+P' and '5'.
 or /pquit

/pnote <text>
            Leave a note to the party you own.
            If <text> is omitted, it will display the current note.
            If <text> is just an '*' char, it will erase the current note.

/pstore     (Also available by pressing 'h' for house menu.)
            Attempts to enter a player store next to you, even if it's your own
            house. So this command is good for 'testing' your own store.
            Usually you simply enter another player's store by trying to enter
            his house, which will preset you with the store screen.
            (See (4.10a) for more information about player stores.)

/pvp        Carries you into/out of the PvP arena. Only usable by pvp-mode
            chars. See (6.13) for details about PvP mode.

/roll and /r are same as /dice and /d respectively (roll some dice).

/sac        Tells a hereticism-user if he may use the spell 'Blood Sacrifice'.
 (/sacrifice)

/xo         gives you an extermination order! It needs to be carried out before
            a certain period of time passes (continues to expire even while not
 (/xorder)  logged on). Completing it yields a random item for reward. It will
            appear in your inventory and carry an inscription indicating
            it's the reward. (See (4.13) for more info.)
            This command is only available in the Ironman Deep Dive Challenge
            dungeon and in the Halls of Mandos. Otherwise you have to visit the
            mayor's office in Bree to receive an extermination order.

/que        Lists your currently pursued quests.
 (/quest)   Specify a quest number to drop a quest -- warning! You might not
            be able to acquire it again, depending on the quest and your quest
            progress.
            If you specify '*' instead of a number, you will drop ALL quests.

/quit       Leaves the game, same as pressing CTRL+Q.
 (/exit, /leave)

/rec        Uses an item inscribed "@R" that provides 'Word of Recall' to
 (/recall)  teleport you over a long distance, either into a dungeon, out of a
            dungeon or across the worldmap.
            See "(0.3) Important Inscriptions, Word of Recall" for more info
            about Word of Recall. Examples:
 /rec -550  recalls you to -550ft, provided there is such a dungeon at your
            current worldmap location and you are not already inside.
 /rec 32 32 recalls you to Bree (the town at (32,32) world map coordinates),
            provided you are on the world surface and not already in Bree.

/ref        redraw the screen (do this if it's messed up for some reason).
 (/refresh, or simply hit CTRL+R)

/bug        report a bug to the admin(s).

/rfe        Store a message/suggestion for the admin(s).

/say <text>
 (/s)       Speaks <text> to players who are currently nearby your position,
            instead of sending your message to everyone on the server.

/whisper <text>
 (/wh)      Whispers <text> to players currently standing right next to you.
            Others won't be able to hear it.

/cough      You cough noisily. Will disturb the sleep of monsters or at least
            make it less deep..

/shout <text>
/yell <text>
            Shout <text> loudly, will wake up monsters.

/scream <text>
            Same as /shout, but also aggravates monsters in your current
            line of sight. (Same effect as scroll of aggravate monsters,
            see (5.9)).

/seen <name>
            Tells you when the character or account of the <name> you
            specified logged in the last time.
            If the name matches both, account and character, it will report the
            account if it's been used more frequently than the character of the
            same name on that account.
            (Same as IRC command ?seen.)

/shot  or  /shot <filename>
 (/screenshot)
            Takes a screen shot to a html file. If <filename> is omitted, it
            writes to 'screenshot?????.xhtml' by default, where ????? are
            increasing numbers. You may also use CTRL+T.
            You can view those xhtml files in most webbrowsers.

/sip        drink from a fountain. You must stand on the fountain to do this.
            Fountains can have good/bad/no effects. There is no fountain of
            death, neither one of detonations, so you won't get instakilled.
            (It's easier to press '_' instead of using the /sip command.
            Also see '_' key above, for additional information.)

/snbar      Cycles through available types of sanity bars to display.
            Which types are available depends on the 'Health' skill.

/stime      Tells you the current date and time (of the server, not of your
            local timezone).

/tag [a..w|* [inscription]]
 or /t      Tags one specific or all uninscribed items in your backpack by
            adding a '!k' or a custom inscription. Helpful for looting in
            conjunction with /dis command.
            If a slot (a..w) is specified, it only tags the item in that
            particular inventory slot (if not yet inscribed already).
            If you want to specify a custom inscription instead of using '!k'
            you have to either specify an inventory slot (a-w) or write a '*'
            for all inventory slots.
            Examples:
            /t        inscribes all uninscribed inventory items '!k'
            /t c      inscribes uninscribed inventory item in slot c) '!k'
            /t * !*   inscribes all uninscribed inventory items '!*'
            /t c !*   inscribes uninscribed inventory item in slot c) '!*'
            Will not affect equipped items.
            Inscriptions can also be undone again with the /ut command.

/tar <x> <y>
 (/target)
            Allows you to target a specific grid specified by X,Y as offset
            to your current character position.

/testyourmight [rs]
or shorter: /tym [rs]
            Displays damage and healing stats for your character, totals and
            averages over number of attacks and over time (# of seconds
            passed).
            Note: 'Numer of attacks' only counts successful attacks, ie not
                  attacks that missed, were blocked/parried/dodged or
                  nullified by invulnerability, etc.
                  It however counts ALL attacks, for example aura hits too.
            Note that for characters moving at high speed and having a high
            number of blows per round, you might need to remove items giving
            +SPEED or +Extra Attacks for the test to be accurate, this is due
            to frame rate limits of the real-time engine, compare (8.7).

/time       Tells you the current in-game time, same as /ex does.

/tip <player>
            Tips a player who must be standing next to you:
            You give him (yourlevel * yourlevel) gold pieces. Eg if you are
            level 10, you'll give him 10*10 = 100 Au. If you are level 50, you
            would give him 2500 Au.
            If you carry less gold than that in your purse, then you only tip
            as much gold as you actually carry.

/trait      Allows outdated Draconian characters to acquire a lineage trait.
            This cannot be reversed, so the player should pick carefully.
            See (6.4) for a list of traits and what they do.

/untag [<inscription>]
 or /ut     If <inscription is omitted, it removes all inscriptions from items
            in your backpack which are exactly '!k' (as done by /tag command).
            Ohterwise it removes inscriptions of all items which are exactly
            inscribed as specified by <inscription>.
            Will not affect equipped items (except for '/untag *').
            Note that some <inscription> parameters are special and therefore
            reserved, those are:

/untag *    will remove all inscriptions from all items in your inventory.

/untag p    will remove all pseudo-id tags from your inventory items.
            Note: This will work on equipped items too!

/untag u    will remove all unique-loot tags from your inventory items.

/at         Apply auto-inscription settings to current inventory.
 (/autotag)

/undoskills
 (/undos)   A skill reset function ("respec"), allowing you to undo the last
            couple of skill points you assigned in 'G' menu. Use this to
            correct points you accidentally put into a wrong skill.
            NOTE: Logging off or gaining another level will reset undoskills,
            making it impossible to undo points spent previously.
            Also, it can only be used ONCE per level, so make sure you get your
            skill point distribution right on the second attempt.

/version    Displays the server version.
 (/ver)

/who <character name>
            Returns the account name that character belongs to, and basic info
            on race, class and level.


(0.2c) IRC bot commands
-----------------------
When in an IRC channel where the 'TomeNET' bot relays chat to and from a
game server, you may enter these IRC commands:
(See (1.1b) on how to set up IRC chat.)

?help           Displays a list of commands.
?players        Will reply with a list of players online on this server.
?seen <name>    Tells you when the character or account of the <name> you
                specified logged in the last time.
                (Same as in-game command /seen.)
?who <character name>
                Returns the account name that character belongs to, and basic
                info on race, class and level. (Same as in-game command /who.)



(0.3) Important inscriptions, Word of Recall
--------------------------------------------
To inscribe an item, press the { key. To uninscribe, press }.
You can also mass-inscribe/uninscribe items by using the commands /tag or /t
and /untag or /ut respectively (see (0.2b) for command details).

All items:
    Inscribing an item with an '!' followed by a key will cause that key to
    cease working on the item anymore. You may also specify several keys.
    A space or other non-related character will end the '!-sequence'.
    Example: You inscribe a 'Scroll of Artifact Creation' this way:  !kd
    Now you cannot destroy or drop the scroll anymore (keys to destroy and
    to drop an item are 'k' respectively 'd').
    You can inscribe an item by pressing '{' and uninscribe it with '}'.

The !* inscription:
    '*' is a 'wild card' which stands for multiple inscriptions at once,
        inscribing an item '!*' will do ALL of these checks:
    !d          Prevent dropping an item.
    !k          Prevent killing (destroying) an item. (Note that '!k' on a
                torch also prevents using that torch to refuel another one.)
    !s          Prevent selling an item to shop (!s).
                For example, if you found an artifact and you want to avoid
                (d)ropping it, (s)elling it, or (v) throwing it away
                accidentally you could eithee inscribe it !dsv or just !* .
    !v          Prevent throwing an item away.
    !=          Automatically pick the item up from the floor.
   (!h          Prevent selling a house key. Keys usually aren't used anymore
                though.)

The !+ inscription:
    Does the same as !* except that it does not prevent dropping an item,
    so it does not imply !d but just !ksv=h (with 'h' being obsolete).

A very useful inscription for (heavily) cursed items:
    !w          Prevent wielding/wearing an item. This is very useful if you
                carry a cursed item in your inventory that you really don't
                want to equip by accident.

Useful for characters who wield a boomerang not for throwing it, but rather
because it provides magical boni:
    !f          Prevent firing an item (ie your equipped ranged weapon).

If you use a sling, bow or crossbow and rather worthless ammo that you don't
intend to pick up again, you may inscribe the ammo to make it disappear:
    !g          Makes ammo always break and never drop to the floor.

Other !-inscriptions:
    !T          Prevent taking off a secondary item.
    !F          Prevent using up this item to fuel your currently equipped
                light source. (Note that !k inscription implies this too.)
    !E          Prevent eating this item.
    !q          Prevent quaffing this potion.
    !r          Prevent reading this scroll.
    !u          Prevent using a staff.
    !a          Prevent aiming a wand.
    !z          Prevent zapping a rod.
    !A          Prevent activating this item.
    !R          Will prevent consuming the last rune in a stack for runespells.
    !L          Can be used on an item that is the target of a scroll of
                Artifact Creation. The resulting randart will not gain +LIFE
                ('it affects your hit points') mod. So this is an inscription
                that only makes sense for winners to use, since non-winners
                cannot generate +LIFE on randarts anyway.
    !U          This item will be displayed in dark grey colour in your
                inventory. Can be useful for sorting loot.


The # inscription:
    This one makes all following inscription be appended directly behind the
    actual item name, instead of at the end of the item's full description.
    It can be especially convenient if the item has a very long name.
    Sometimes you can also use this to confuse your fellow players :-p

(The '..' inscription is no longer available since 'Thunderlord' ego weapons
no longer have the TELEPORT flag.)

Items that 'can cause Earthquakes':
    !Q          Prevents the item from causing an earthquake. This usually
                only works on the artifact "The Mighty Hammer 'Grond'".
                (Press keys  ~d  in the game to check server settings.)
                See (5.13) for more information about earthquakes.

Weapons, devices and spells:
    @O          This and its variants control the 'auto-retaliator' which is a
                mechanism designed to make your character automatically attack
                targets that are standing directly adjacent to you.
                For details about auto-retaliation and the different types of
                @O... inscriptions, see (4.1a)!

Rods only:
    !C          Will notify you when the rod finished recharging.

Wands and directional rods:
    !K          Will enable fire-till-kill mode for this item, provided that
                you have turned on fire-till-kill mode the usual way ('m' key).

Ammunition:
    !=          Will make your character auto-pickup the ammo from the floor.
    !g          Will make your ammunition break. Rather disadvantageous but
                maybe useful if you don't like littering the floor with it.
    !M          Makes ammunition stacks of same base type and same ego power
                stack even if +hit or +dam enchantments are not equal. Those
                will be averaged and rounded downwards. (Doesn't work for
                cursed or artifact ammo.) Wield the !M stack first, then also
                wield the stack you want to merge with the equipped ammo.
    !L          Inscribe stacks of ammo in your inventory !L to make them be
                automatically reloaded into your quiver as soon as the ammo
                you're currently using runs out.
                Note that you can place ammo in your inventory in the desired
                order for reloading by dropping it/picking it up again!
                The !L inscription also works for boomerangs.

Sling ammunition:
    !R          Prevents ricochetting.

Scrolls/spell books of Identify (except for bag-ID), Rods/Staves of Perception:
    !X          If you pick up an unidentified item, you will automatically
                read a scroll to identify it.
                This inscription also works on 'The Stone of Lore'.
                It does not work for Arcane Lore, since that is purely a bag ID
                spell.
                Note that it will attempt to re-cast the ID spell until it
                succeeds or you're out of mana. Use with care.
                See (5.7) for more information about identification.

An item that can be activated:
    @A1         Pressing the keys 'A' and then '1' will activate that item.

A potion:
    @q3         Pressing 'q' then '3' will quaff that potion.

A magic scroll:
    @r0         Pressing the keys 'r' and '0' will read that scroll.

etc.. you get the idea. :)

You can also inscribe items just to remember their abilities. For example
if you find an armour that is an artifact, and you found out it resists
fire and acid, you might inscribe it {ResFire,ResAcid} so that you will
remember what it does just by looking at it and reading the inscription.
It can make your life easier if you wear lots of items that have different
resistances or abilities. A shortcut is the...

Item power inscription (added in 4.7.1):
    @@         Will automatically inscribe an item with codes representing its
               special powers. Only works with *identified* items.


"Word of Recall", provided by items (scrolls and rods) or spells:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you use these without inscription, they will just teleport you back into the
dungeon you came from, to the deepest possible floor. If you use them on the
world surface without inscription and there is no dungeon at your location that
you have previously visited, they will instead teleport you back to the last
town you visited.
    @R500       will teleport you to depth 500ft (tower).
    @R-350      will teleport you to depth -350ft (dungeon).
    @RW32,32    will teleport you to sector 32,32 on the worldmap (Bree).
                World map ranges from 0,0 to 63,63.
    or even better..
    @R          This inscription makes the above versions sort of obsolete.
                If you have inscribed a Word of Recall item like this then you
                can just type the command    /rec    into chat to invoke the
                Word of Recall. Examples replacing above inscriptions:
                /rec 500
                /rec -350
                /rec 32 32        <- notice: No komma between the coordinates!

    NOTES:
    1) You must've already been at that depth or deeper in order to teleport
       there via WoR!
    2) In order to recall to a place on the world map, you need to have been
       there before, NOT while you were dead (ghost), but while you were
       alive! Temple priests actually won't revive ghosts either who have not
       been to this place alive previously. So don't try to travel to Gondolin
       as a ghost, the priest over there will reject you and you won't remember
       the place when you return and revive in Bree.
    3) You can recall either across the world map or into/out of a dungeon, but
       not both at once. So if you want to go from Bree into the Orc Cave, you
       need two scrolls, first to go from Bree to the Orc Cave entrance located
       on the world surface, second to teleport down into the Orc Caves.
    4) Note that Word of Recall has a maximum range when used to travel across
       the world map. So if you want to recall from town A to town B you might
       require more than one recall spell depending on the distance.
    5) If you cast another Word of Recall while you're still waiting for one to
       kick in, the effect will be cancelled! That way you can change your mind
       if you suddenly spot a monster you want to go and kill after you already
       read a scroll of WoR.
    6) After being recalled the player will receive 'stair goi' (a temporary
       extra protection from taking damage) for a short amount of time, see
       (0.4) for details.

    EXAMPLE:
    A player is in Bree (32,32) and wants to recall to Orc Cave -300ft which we
    assume is located at (31,25) and he has already been there before, so he
    can use Word of Recall to get there. He has his WoR scrolls inscribed '@R'
    and now types the following chat commands in order:
        /rec 31 25
        (he waits until that kicked in and transported him to Orc Cave surface)
        /rec -300
        (this will bring him to the desired depth, from the surface).


(0.3a) The auto-inscription feature
-----------------------------------
Since it can be annoying to keep inscribing newly bought items again and again,
there is an auto-inscription feature which you can access with '&' key.
Remotely similar to the macro menu, a list of auto-inscriptions appears (which
by default is empty).

Press 'e' to edit the first auto-inscription. A cursor will appear, allowing
you to input a partial item name. For example type in 'of Healing' (without the
quotes). Hit ENTER key to confirm. Now the cursor will allow you to enter an
inscription, a little bit further to the right on the screen. For example type
in '@q1' (again without the quotes) and confirm with ENTER key again.

Now you have just set up an auto-inscription that will automatically inscribe
'@q1' whenever any item is added to your inventory which has a name containing
'of Healing', ie 'Potions of Healing'.

Note that auto-inscriptions are case-sensitive, and only the first one in the
list that actually matches an item is applied to it.

You can use '?' as wildcard in the search string. For example if you want to
distinguish between Rod(s) of Healing and Potion(s) of Healing, you can use
'Rod?Healing' and 'Potion?Healing' respectively.
('?' stands for any number (including zero) of any characters.)

If you put a '!' as first character of a search string, it will force the
inscription to overwrite existing inscriptions in any case (usually it only
overwrites trivial inscriptions such as price discount tags).

Auto-inscription files can be saved and will be loaded automatically in the
same manner as macro files, if the filename matches your race, class, account
or character name.
If multiple matching files are found, the game will attempt to merge them
accordingly.

To immediately apply an auto-inscription that you just added or modified,
use the  /at  command.

NOTE: In addition to this user-defined client-side auto-inscription list, there
      is also a server-side auto-inscription feature that can be enabled via
      client option 'auto_inscribe'.
      This option will add a predefined set of auto-inscriptions that might be
      generally useful for all types of characters, see (2.3) for details.



(0.4) Typical slang/abbreviations
---------------------------------
Art         Artifact. Those can be 'Static arfifacts' from the a_info.txt
            file, also called 'True Arts'. Or they may be 'Randomly generated
            artifacts' also called 'Randarts'.
            In game you can press  ~ 6  to search for any static artifact.
            (See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)
            Winners who beat Morgoth, Lord of Darkness will usually not
            be able to use static artifacts, but rely on randarts instead.
            Depending on the server settings, fallen winners might also not be
            able to use static arts.
            See (5.9b) for more information about artifacts.

Auto-ID     A special ability of some items. If you equip an item that grants
            you 'Auto-ID' all items you touch will automatically be
            identified! Items who grant their wielder Auto-Identification are
            highly sought after. Randart helmets or gloves sometimes have it.
            See (5.7) for more information about identification.

BM          Black Market (Store '7').

Cheeze      Questionable action, not quite cheating but close to it.
            This can be transferring items to a store character (mule)
            or exploiting weaknesses in the game design instead of
            reporting them to the forum.

DEW         Dark-elven warlock. A very deadly monster that comes in packs and
            shoots high-damage mana bolts, glass cannon style.

Dive        A trip into the dungeon, usually quite deep compared to the
            diver's character level.

DSM         Dragon Scale Mail. Legendary pieces of armour.

Excellents  Items that pseudo-identified as 'excellent'.

EA          Extra Attacks. Rings, gloves or weapons which increase your number
            of blows per round with melee weapons. Quite expensive.

FA          Free Action (immunity to paralysis).

FF          Feather falling.

GoI         Globe of invulnerability. This only exists as 'Stair GoI', see
            further below.

Gorth       Room in the dungeon, divided into 4 chambers, similar to a pit.
            Also see 'Room', 'Pit' and (4.6).

GV          Greater Vault. (See (4.6))

GCV         Greater Checkerboard Vault (looks remotely like a checkerboard).

ID, *ID*    Identify and *Identify* magic respectively, which is used to
            reveal magic properties of unknown items. Scrolls of ID can be
            bought in store 5.
            See (5.7) for more information about identification.

Iron Team   A special type of party which can only be formed with newly
            created characters. Its members only gain experience if all
            members are online and on the same dungeon level.
            Also, members can only trade items and money with other members.

kinging     The process of beating Morgoth, the game boss, and thereby
            acquiring a royal title (king/queen/emperor/empress).
            Such player characters are also referred to as 'winners'.
            A player must be at least level 40 to get credit for beating
            Morgoth.

 rekinging  Fallen winners, ie players who beat Morgoth but later on died and
            thereby lost their royal title again, can attempt to regain it by
            teaming up with someone who has not yet defeated Morgoth.
            If that person lands the killing blow, everyone in her/his party
            on the same floor will gain winner status again, even fallen kings.
            A player must be at least level 40 to get credit for beating
            Morgoth.
            A new (experimental) way to obtain a lost royal title again is to
            donate and pray in 'The Mirror' in Lothlorien, see (4.5a) for
            details.

klevel, olevel
            Somewhat more technical terms, these stand for the exact type of
            item level that is meant in a certain context:
            k-level is the 'object kind level', which is given in k_info.txt.
            This is the object's base level and describes from which minimum
            dungeon floor level or minimum monster level you can expect to
            start getting that item type.
            The o-level is the 'real' object level that you'll see on an item
            you pick up. This can vary from the klev, depending on the dungeon
            floor depth and monster level you got the item from.
            Example: According to k_info.txt an Amulet of the Serpents has a
            klev of 25, so you can expect to start seeing this drop on dungeon
            level 25 (1250ft) or from level 25 monsters respectively. However,
            when you find such an amulet on say a dungeon floor at 4000ft,
            which equals dungeon level 80, an actual amulet you find might have
            a level requirement (olev) of 30.
            (Note: This is similar to mlevel vs rlevel for monsters.)

Loot        Items that have been dropped by dead monsters or players and
            are waiting to be picked up by someone. :)

LV          Lesser Vault. (See (4.6))

mlevel, rlevel
            Somewhat more technical terms, these stand for the exact type of
            monster level that is meant in a certain context:
            m-level is the 'real' monster level that you'll also see when you
            have your character look at it. This level may actually be boosted
            and therefore be higher than you'd expect. This happens when you
            meet the monster on a floor that is far deeper than the level the
            monster usually starts to occur on.
            r-level is the base monster level (race level), which you can see
            in game if you press  ~ 7  and search for a particular monster.
            It describes the minimum floor level a monster is usually found on
            (although 'out-of-depth' occurances may be possible).

            Example: According to ~7, Ancient Red Dragons have a base level of
            41. That means you'll usually start seeing them on dungeon floors
            of level 41 (2050 ft) and deeper, although there's always a slim
            chance that you meet a monster earlier than its base level (called
            OoD encounter, "Out of Depth").
            So we know now that the r-level of Ancient Red Dragons is 41.
            However, if you meet an Ancient Red Dragon on a much deeper dungeon
            floor, say 2450 ft, which would be the equivalent to level 49, when
            you look at the dragon you'll see it says level 42 instead of the
            expected 41. This means the dragon's level was actually slightly
            boosted because the dungeon floor's level was that much higher than
            the dragon's. So while the rlev of this dragon is still 41, its
            real level, the mlev, is 42.

            Monsters that are on dungeon floors 8 levels or higher above their
            base level will get an increase in levels of +1 for every 3 floors,
            so +1 level at 8 dungeon levels above their r-level, +2 at 11,
            +3 at 14 etc..
            Monsters randomly gain hit points, speed, AC or damage dice/sides
            for their melee attacks on each level-up. To find out in what way a
            particular monster has been boosted you can use a rod of probing.

            Some formulas used by the game use mlev, some use rlev.
            (Note: This is similar to klevel vs olevel for items.)

Morgy       Morgoth, Lord of Darkness. Final boss enemy in TomeNET.
            See (1.3) for details.

Nazgul weapon or RW weapon
            An artifact weapon that doesn't really excel, but since it's an
            artifact it can still be put to good use as a weapon for killing
            nazgul (the nine ringwraiths, see (1.3a)).
            Since nazgul still have a 1 in 1000 chance to destroy an artifact
            weapon on hit, you don't want to put your best weapons at risk.
            So using a mediocre artifact instead that you'd otherwise just sell
            to a store seems like a good idea, since it won't be much of a loss
            if it breaks, and it will usually still get the job done as long as
            its weapon class fits the type of your trained mastery skill.

Nest        Originally also just called 'pits', nests only differ from pits in
            the monsters in them being strewn around in a randomly mixed manner
            while pits contain 'organized' rings and circles of monsters.
            The monsters in a nest are not completely random but follow certain
            schemes. For example all monsters in a 'clones nest' are exactly
            the same type. Also see 'pits'.

olevel      see klevel.

OoD         Out-of-depth. Means a monster or an item encounter that happened at
            a surprisingly shallow level, opposed to the base level for that
            monster (shown in ~7) or item (given in k_info.txt) where
            you would usually start expecting to find it.
            Vaults often containing OoD monsters and items, increasing threat
            and reward for the brave.
            Note: OoD is limited to at most +40 levels (happens in high-level
            vaults); unique monsters can actually only be up to 20 levels OoD
            (even in vaults) and, as a specialty, Great Wyrms of Power can only
            ever occur up to 10 levels OoD.

Party       A group of players who fight together and share experience.
            In a party you will share experience points if you are within 7
            character levels to each other and on the same dungeon/tower level
            respectively the same worldmap/wilderness sector.
            You can invoke the party menu with shift+p key. See (6.9).

Phase Door  A short-range teleportation.

Pit         Pits contain monsters of a certain type, for example 'demon pits'
            or 'orc pits', with the monsters in them being placed in a somewhat
            'organized' manner of rings and circles. Also see 'Nest' or 'Room'.
            Pits are often confused with special rooms.

Post-King   The life of a character within the level range above level 50.
Pre-King    The life of a character within the level range 1 to 50.

Pseudo-ID   If a player keeps an unidentified item for a longer time he might
            'feel' if the item is average, good, cursed or special. The item
            will automatically receive a 'pseudo-id inscription' then.
            Pseudo-id intensity and speed depend on the 'Combat' skill.
            It does not matter whether the player is acting, afk or idle.
            See (5.7) for more information about identification.

PvP         Player vs player. Describes the act of player characters fighting
            each other. If you want to fight other players to death, create a
            new 'pvp-mode' character. It's an option during the character
            creation process, much like 'everlasting mode' or 'normal mode'.
            For more information about pvp mode, see (6.13).

Randart     Randomly generated artifact. As opposed to 'Truearts' which are
 Randy      also called 'Static arts' from the file a_info.txt (you can search
            static arts by pressing  ~ 6  in game). See 'Art' at the top of
            this section for more information.
            See (5.9b) for more information about artifacts.

Res         Resistance.

Room        The dungeon contains many rooms connected by passages. Some of the
            rooms are of special shape. Especially rooms containing a further,
            inner room similarly to pits are thereby often confused with those,
            mostly 'Gorths' (rooms divided into four chambers containing a
            lot of monsters), 'Checkerboard-Rooms' (rooms containing a
            checkerboard-like maze structure and a lot of monsters).

rlevel      see mlevel.

Scumming    Repeatedly using staircases up/downwards to make a level become
            recreated. Usually in hope of finding a specific monster on that
            depth. ('I scum 450..500 ft for Wormy'.)

SI          See invisible.

Specials    Items that pseudo-identify as 'special'. These are true arts or
            randarts.

Static      A level that is static will not change if you leave it but stay
            the same, permanently until it is unstaticed.
            All levels remain static for a short period of time after the
            last player leaves them to prevent scumming.
            Also, levels remain static if a player ghost-died (meaning he died
            ultimatively without possibility of resurrection) for a longer
            while depending on the dungeon level, see (3.11) for details about
            static-by-death levels.

Static Art  See 'Art' at the top of this section.

Stair GoI   Stair-Goi is a very short-lasting globe of invulnerability (usually
            2 to 3 turns). It is a magical protection effect that any player
            who takes a staircase up or down or uses Word of Recall will
            automatically receive: A temporary buff of +100 armour class
            and 40% chance to deflect any attacks that hit him. Attacks that
            aren't deflected still get their damage halved.
            When an attack is deflected, you get a message saying:
            "The attack is fully deflected by a magic shield."

True Art    See 'Art' at the top of this section.

Unique      A monster that is named and exists only once. Although it can
            respawn for another player who hasn't defeated it yet, each player
            will receive loot only once from it. So if you engage a unique
            monster while playing together with a team mate, check if you have
            already killed it and if so let your team mate inflict the killing
            blow, so he will get the kill credited and the monster will drop
            loot accordingly.
            To verify whether you have already killed a unique, you may..
            -check the unique monster list in '~' menu.
            -'l'ook at the monster, the name will be shown in dark grey if you
             already got kill credit for it.
            -watch the damage messages when you attack it, they will be shown
             in dark grey if you already killed it.
            -turn on the option 'unique_kill_credit' in '=' menu: It will beep
             if you hit a unique monster that you have already killed.
            It is good etiquette that you don't touch the (inscribed) loot a
            unique monster drops if it wasn't you who killed it in the end.
            That's precisely because every player can only get kill credit for
            each unique monster once.
            Uniques often have large escorts.

            Note that a unique monster cannot occur in two or more different
            places in the whole game world at the _same time_ - with the only
            exception being the IDDC (Ironman Deep Dive Challenge) which is a
            closed ecosystem and has unique monsters spawn independently from
            the rest of the game world.
            So if you are desperately looking for a unique monster and can't
            seem to make it spawn, ask in chat if someone else sees that
            particular monster on his current dungeon level. Then wait till
            they have left that level or killed the unique so it will be ready
            to spawn again for you, or maybe they will tell you that you can
            come over to kill it there in place.

            Unique monsters will randomly respawn for winners, ie Kings,
            Queens, Emperors and Empresses. That means: The game will "forget"
            that you already defeated them, allowing you to defeat them once
            more. There are some exceptions though, the following monsters
            will never respawn: The Nazgul, Sauron, Michael, Morgoth, and all
            super-uniques that come after Morgoth, starting with Tik'srvzllat.

            This respawning happens (albeit very slowly) while you are logged
            on with your winner character, except while you're in town or in
            the area around a town (housing zone).

WoR         Word of Recall (teleports you into the dungeon and back or on the
            world map). See "(0.3) Important inscriptions, Word of Recall" for
            more info.

Wormy       Wormtongue, Agent of Saruman. He drops great items.



(0.5) Some hints and warnings (READ!)
-------------------------------------
-To report a bug use the /bug command in the game. It allows you to type a line
 of text to explain the bug or problem you encountered. You can use the /bug
 command multiple times if one line is not sufficient for the amount of text
 you want to write.
 Alternatively, you can use the bug report section of the official forum at
 www.tomenet.eu.
 Please DO NOT write bugs in chat in the game.

-If you have a suggestion, use the /rfe command instead. It's used the same way
 as the /bug command (see above).
 Alternatively, use the forum at www.tomenet.eu.

-Starting at version 4.4.5, TomeNET supports audio, that is, sound effects and
 background music. To find out more, read (2.1a).

-Usually characters expire (that means they are automatically deleted!)
 after 366 days of inactivity. Empty accounts (ie accounts that don't hold any
 characters) usually expire after 62 days.

-Items on the ground (especially in towns) often disappear automatically after
 a while. So don't use the town or the wilderniss to 'store' loot.
 If you don't own any houses, you can use public houses that are accessible to
 everyone. Risk is of course that someone takes your items.

-If you press CTRL+Q to save&exit the game, you should do that in a safe town.
 Dungeons might change while you are logged off, and the next time you log on
 you might find yourself in a nasty place if unlucky.
 Another problem is that if you don't leave in a town (or the housing area
 around a town), your character will stay for another 20-30 seconds in the game
 before it finally disappears from the dungeon (or world surface)! If monsters
 were around, you might get killed easily during that time.

-The items you find don't depend on your race or class but on monster level
 and depth and luck.

-Don't drop artifacts inside houses if the server doesn't allow artifacts to
 be dropped inside player houses, or you will simply lose the artifact!

-Items on the floor within a house don't form piles! If you drop too many
 items and space in the house runs out the dropped item may just disappear!

-The massive iron crown of Morgoth must not be worn by non-Kings/Queens!
 Wearing it otherwise will kill you in a mighty blast.

-Some special shops' features may currently not be available.

-Some monster abilities are currently not available/implemented:
 BO_POIS, HAND_DOOM, RAISE_DEAD.

-Some item abilities are currently not available/implemented:
 LEVELS.

-Monsters that pick up an item have a 30% chance to NOT drop it again on death.

-The dungeon floor/world sector you are in, be it on the world surface, in town
 or in the dungeon, has a chance of slowly spawning new monsters over time.
 Those will always be awake.
 The rules are the same as for when a dungeon level gets generated:
 Everything that fits the dungeon's theme (if any) is allowed, the monster
 level might occasionally spike out-of-depth, up to 40 levels above the floor
 level. This can be especially nasty because these spawns will not change the
 floor feeling, so you won't notice it except when you spot the monster.



(1) Introduction
================

(1.1) What is TomeNET? (Where can I get the latest sources?)
------------------------------------------------------------
TomeNET is an extremely advanced online multiplayer rogue-like role-playing
game, derived from MAngband (Multiplayer-Angband). It's based on the stories of
J.R.R. Tolkien mainly, hence the name "the Troubles of Middle Earth" or
alternatively "the Tales of Middle Earth".
The final goal in TomeNET is to destroy the fallen god Melkor who is known by
the name of Morgoth, Lord of Darkness. The official websites are mentioned in
the first couple of lines of this guide.
Note that ToME and TomeNET although both coming from similar roots are actually
quite different games that are maintained by different persons/teams.

If you want to download the source code, you can get it from www.tomenet.eu in
the download section.


(1.1a) Where do I get in contact?
---------------------------------
Apart from downloading the game client and playing, you can also get in contact
with other players and developers via the following media:

-The forum at http://www.tomenet.eu/.
-IRC: Channel #tomenet on server irc.freenode.net (port 6667)
      (For help on Internet Relay Chat visit www.irchelp.org).
      The channel #tomenet relays chat from and to the game server, allowing
      you to read what's going on in-game, and to chat with players simply
      with any IRC client.
      See below (1.1b) for how to set up IRC chat in detail.
      See (0.2c) for commands you can send to the TomeNET IRC bot.
-Voice chat via mumble, get it from http://mumble.sourceforge.net/.
      IP is 'europe.tomenet.eu', port is '23348', password is 'tomenet'.
      For details see "(2.4) Installing voice chat".


(1.1b) How to set up IRC chat
-----------------------------
Easiest method: Use the official webclient provided by the 'Freenode' IRC
server. Start your internet browser and enter this URL:
  https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23tomenet
You will be prompted to enter a chat name of your choice and to click the box
saying "I'm not a robot", then you can click the "Connect" button and voila.
(The channel name "#tomenet" should have already been filled in for you.)

If you prefer to use a stand-alone IRC chat client instead of using a browser-
based chat, here are some suggestions:

Windows: Most popular client is probably mIRC.

Linux: Popular IRC clients for Linux are Pidgin (actually rather a multi-
       protocol messaging tool, pretty nifty), x-chat (GUI), Konversation (KDE
       GUI) or irssi (command-line).

Mac OSX: For example Colloquy, X-Chat Aqua or Linkinus.

After installing your preferred IRC chat client, enter an username of your
choice and set it up to connect to the "Freenode" IRC network.
(For detailed help on Internet Relay Chat visit www.irchelp.org.)

After you established a connection to Freenode, have your client join the
so-called "channel" (all chat channels on IRC networks are denoted by a
hashtag in front of them) named:

 #tomenet

Joining a channel will relay chat from and to the TomeNET server, allowing you
to read what's going on in-game, and to chat with the players.
(Note that not all kinds of messages are actually relayed, for example AFK
messages are not.)
See (0.2c) for commands you can send to the TomeNET IRC bot.

Usually all IRC clients offer a possibility to configure them to connect a
specific network (Freenode) and to join specific channels (#tomenet etc.)
automatically on startup, so you don't have to do it manually each time you
start the IRC client.

Most clients also allow you to setup auto-reconnect, which is useful if you
experience frequent disconnections from the IRC network. Although in that case
you should rather check why that happens - make sure you aren't trying to
connect to a very far away Freenode server but to one that is close to your
location, compare:  http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml



(1.2) What is a rogue-like game?
--------------------------------
Rogue was a game basing only on alpha-numerical characters, like letters and
numbers. It didn't have any graphics. Thus it could run on basically every
simple computer. However it was not a text-adventure. Its game engine provides
a grid for turn-by-turn movement and combat that the user looks at from high
above. Here is a small "screenshot":
...............
...########....
...#$.....#....
...#..@...'....
...#......#....
...########.p..
...............
The @ is usually the player, the dots are empty fields. The # are walls. Here
the player seems to be inside a building. In the upper-left corner some money
is deposited. The ' is an open door. Outside of the building there is a p,
which is usually some townsfolk. They are not always friendly and some tend to
steal! Rogue was the first game of this kind, hence all games working with
similar graphics and game engine are called rogue-likes.
Other well-known rogue-likes are Nethack, Larn, Moria, Angband.


(1.2a) Where do I find more information about rogue-like games?

    rec.games.roguelike.*



(1.3) Goal and progress of TomeNET players
------------------------------------------
The final goal that a brave adventurer could possible seek in TomeNET is to
become King respectively Queen. To acquire this he or she must destroy the
fallen god Melkor who is known by the name of Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.

Morgoth is said to reside deep within the dungeons at around 5000 feet down in
the earth. Getting there will be an extraordinary journey bearing unbelievable
dangers but also fantastic treasure. Players on the same server can also play
together by forming parties and sharing their experience! Players will acquire
new ranks as their experience grows, allowing them to learn new abilities and
to become stronger. Morgoth is said not to show up until his servant Sauron,
the Sorceror has been defeated. (See (1.3a) for details about Morgoth.)

On their journey through wilderness and remote towns, towers and dungeons,
characters will gain experience points that increase their level up to 50.
After defeating Morgoth, they will be able to advance further up to level 99.

Players who defeat Morgoth, become 'winners' and get the title of King and
Queen respectively, or Emperor/Empress if their character is of unworldly or
hellish mode. A player must be at least level 40 to get credit for this.

When you win the game, an automatic chardump is generated in /lib/user called
'<charname>-victory.txt' (see (8.2)) which you can view with any text editor.
Also, a screenshot is made automatically, displaying your situation, saved
to '<charname>-victory-screenshot.xhtml'.
(You can view xhtml files in most webbrowsers.)


(1.3a) Sauron, Morgoth and the Nazgul
-------------------------------------
Morgoth, Lord of Darkness commands nine Ring Wraiths, called 'Nazgul'.
These corrupted souls of former ring-wearers are named..
Uvatha the Horseman, Adunaphel the Quiet, Akhorahil the Blind,
Ren the Unclean, Ji Indur Dawndeath, Dwar Dog Lord of Waw, Hoarmurath of Dir,
Khamul the Black Easterling and The Witch-King of Angmar.
Morgoth has the ability to summon these, so you should destroy them all
before facing him.

Morgoth is also able to summon other powerful unique beings, so one of your
tasks to prevail against him will be to kill off as many of the powerful unique
foes as you can before facing him.

Morgoth, the god of destruction, has reinforced his surroundings to be
especially devastating to all living beings:
If you get killed on a level where Morgoth, Lord of Darkness walks, your
ghost will be destroyed too, even if you are everlasting! Beware!

If you team up against him, he will grow stronger for every additional player
who enters his dungeon level. Growing stronger in fact means that he gains a
hit point and speed bonus. If a player leaves his level, he will weaken again.
See the following paragraph (1.6) for more information.

When a player lands the killing blow on Morgoth, everyone else who is in her or
his party and also on the same dungeon floor will get credit for winning the
game too and receive a royal title accordingly. Even 'fallen winners' (players
who have beaten Morgoth already but lost their royal title to death) can
regain their title this way - by teaming up with someone who hasn't defeated
Morgoth yet and making sure that that player lands the killing blow.
Each player must be at least level 40 to get credit for beating Morgoth.
A new (experimental) way to obtain a lost royal title again is to donate and
pray in 'The Mirror' in Lothlorien, see (4.5a) for details.

Morgoth always drops his crown and hammer. If he is defeated by a party, those
two items will drop multiple times so that everyone can actually pick up one of
each.

A very dangerous thing about Nazgul is that weapons get quickly destroyed if
they come in contact with these corrupted beings.
If you are a spell-caster who doesn't use his weapon to fight but just to
profit from its magical abilities then it's strongly recommended to inscribe
the weapon @Ox to avoid auto-retaliation, see (0.3) about inscriptions and
(4.1a) about auto-retaliation.
If you rely on melee weapons you must try to get your hands on an artifact
since these resist Nazgul greatly! The Stormbringer also resists like an
artifact. (It doesn't matter if the artifact is a random or a static one.)
If your weapon gets destroyed you'll receive a warning message:
"Your weapon *DISINTEGRATES*!" or "Your weapon is destroyed !"
(The permanently cursed weapon 'Mighty Hammer of Grond' cannot be destroyed.
See (5.9b) for more information about artifacts.)

Your weapon itself will not damage the Nazgul if it doesn't have one of the
mods SLAY_EVIL, SLAY_UNDEAD or KILL_UNDEAD and if it isn't a Morgul weapon.
However, you will still be able to damage the Nazgul, if your raw to-dam
bonus is high enough. Enchantments from rings, gloves or other items and the
damage bonus from your skills will be the only factors which decide the damage
you deal, in that case.
For weapons which damage dice and to-dam bonus will not be counted (ie non-
SLAY/KILL EVIL/UNDEAD or Morgul weapons) you'll see the message:
"The Ringwraith is IMPERVIOUS to the mundane weapon."

Note: Having those slay/kill mods on gloves (or other items) instead of the
      weapon does not help! They will not count.

      However - the 'slay undead' bonus received from Holy Offense school at a
      skill of 30.000 will infuse your weapon and will make its dice and damage
      count again, as if the weapon itself had the slay mod!

Martial Arts users can fight relatively efficiently against Nazgul, but their
chance to receive Black Breath is higher than for weapon users.

If you come in contact with a Nazgul or a very powerful undead creature there
is a chance that you will be infected by the Black Breath. This dark aura is
able to infect other players if you come too close to them. It will drain your
stats and permanently drain your experience. Slowly, but steadily. There are
several possibilities to cure Black Breath, for example Sprigs of Athelas.
Players cannot infect other players with Black Breath if they are in Bree or in
the Training Tower, those are safe zones.

Each Nazgul will drop a ring of power, which is a random artifact ring bearing
the Nazgul's name. These rings have a lot of random mods (ie abilities) and
will always provide invisibility (5.16) and experience drain (5.19). They are
also always heavily cursed, cannot be dropped while cursed, and can re-curse
themselves (5.14).

In order to find Morgoth, players have to defeat Sauron, the Sorceror first.
For more information about encountering Sauron and Morgoth, see next paragraph
(1.3b).
It is noteworthy that Sauron is able to boost his own spell-casting speed for
as long as he finds himself or the area around his target blocked by Glyphs of
Warding (also called Runes of Protection).
Also, he might try to avoid going into melee range of players who he deems good
at close quarters combat. In general, do not underestimate Sauron's power!


(1.3b) How to encounter the final boss: Morgoth, Lord of Darkness
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-Morgoth is found only at dungeon level 100 or deeper.
-He won't show up until you defeated Sauron, the Sorceror, who is found at the
 bottom of Mt Doom (which is dungeon level 99).
-Morgoth does not neccessarily spawn on each fitting dungeon level,
 sometimes you have to search for him, like for all other monsters/uniques.
-If a player who hasn't defeated Sauron yet or who has already beaten Morgoth
 enters a dungeon level where Morgoth is currently on, Morgoth will instantly
 teleport to a different dungeon level.
-If there's already another player on that level who has beaten Sauron but
 hasn't acquired the title of a King or Queen yet, the 'intruder' player will
 be teleported to town instead and Morgoth will remain on the level.
-If more than one player is on his floor, he will be a bit thougher than he
 appears to a solo player, depending on the number of players facing him.
 In details, for each additional player besides the first player joining his
 level, Morgoth gains +20000 hit points and +6 speed. So if a team of three
 challenges him, he will have 30000+2*20000 = 70000 HP and 30+2*6 = 42 speed.
 Everyone who is at least level 40 and on the same dungeon floor and in the
 same party as the player who lands the killing blow will get credit for
 winning the game and receive a royal title accordingly.
-There are no obstacles that can hold Morgoth back for long.

See (1.3a) for more information about Morgoth.

There are rumours of even more powerful beings than the Lord Of Darkness.
Kings and Queens who seek new challenges shall try to enter the Nether Realm,
a dungeon with dangers beyond imagination. Only those who destroyed Morgoth
may enter. The Nether Realm can be very rewarding in terms of experience but
also very deadly. Terrible foes are said to dwell there which aren't seen in
the mundane world. See (4.5c) for more information about the Nether Realm.



(2) Installation & setup
========================

(2.1) Installing/updating TomeNET
---------------------------------

Updating:
---------
Starting with version 4.5.7a, TomeNET comes with an updater tool that should
work on most platforms. If it doesn't on yours, please contact us and provide
details about which operating system you are using.

To update your TomeNET client or the sound pack or music pack, just run the
'TomeNET-Updater' and click on the according button.
The only prerequisite is that you must have '7-Zip' installed, a great, free,
open source archiver that beats WinRAR and WinZIP easily. You can get it from
www.7-zip.org.
Important: You should exit the game before attempting to update it!
Note for LINUX:
The Linux version of the TomeNET-Updater no longer requires 7zG (the graphical
user interface of 7-zip), so you do not need to compile it yourself if your
repository packages don't provide it. If you want to compile it anyway then see
(2.1a) and there "a) Automatic audio pack installation - LINUX". That paragraph
has short instructions on how to compile 7-zip from source in Linux.


Installation from scratch:
--------------------------
(Covered are Windows, Linux, OSX, FreeBSD.)

Go to http://www.tomenet.eu/ (or one of our personal pages) to download the
latest client. Extract it to a new directory, preserving the pathnames.

(Note: If you decide to download the 'test client' instead of the client of the
latest stable version number, be aware that it might stop working correctly
unexpectedly because it's undergoing development, possibly forcing you to
redownload it.)


Windows:
--------
To extract the TomeNET zip package you downloaded, 7-zip is recommended.
It's a free and open source zip-tool of outstanding performance that works on
all platforms. Grab it from http://www.7-zip.org/ .

After extracting, you're good to go. If you're already tired of reading, just
double-click TomeNET.exe, pick the first official server in the list, make up
an account and character and start to play.

There is also a manual in your TomeNET folder, the file is called
"TomeNET-Guide.txt". Double-click to read it. It is recommended to not open it
in Wordpad, but either in Notepad or in any web browser of your choice, because
Wordpad tends to warp the layout badly.
Alternatively you can find the latest version of the manual online for browsing
and easy searching, on the TomeNET homepage (http://www.tomenet.eu/).

If you're tech savvy, you could decide to edit the game configuration manually,
but that is not really required. Continue reading below if you want to do that.

Otherwise, you could skip forward to (2.1a) now, where you find an explanation
on how to install the music pack.

When you're done with everything, you can continue reading at (2.1d) if you are
using Valve's Steam, and then at (2.2) to find how how to actually connect to
the TomeNET game server, create an account, create a character, and play the
game!


Windows - Manually editing the configuration file (if you're tech savvy):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may edit the file "TomeNET.ini" and do some changes to your likings, like
setting up window positions (note that the game will remember window positions
changed via dragging the windows around, which is an easier way), or choosing
font size (look into lib/xtra/font directory to see available fonts).
Further you can specify an account name and password to be filled in
automatically, and various other things.

Last but not least, you may use the following command-line options:
-p<Port>                for example -p19348
-l<Account> <Password>  for example -lGandalf geheim
-N<character name>      for example -NDruidor
<ip address>            for example 37.187.75.24
-q                      turns off loading/initializing of audio ('quiet mode')
-w                      disables weather effects
-u                      disables automatic LUA script updating
-k                      don't disable numlock on client startup
-m                      skip motd (message of the day) on login
-v                      automatically save chat log on exit

(Skip down to (2.1a) to continue reading.)


Linux (using pre-compiled client):
----------------------------------
Make sure that ncurses and crypt libraries are installed, package names are
usually libncurses5 and libgcrypt11.
Enter the 'tomenet/' folder and type:
        ./tomenet
to start the game.


Linux (compiling from source):
------------------------------
There are additional distribution-specific information on Mikael's website at:
http://muuttuja.org/tomenet/installation-linux.php
(It's linked on www.tomenet.eu -> "Links".)

You can get the source from www.tomenet.eu, also see (1.1).

How to compile the game binary:
Go into '/tomenet/src' where the file 'makefile' is located.

Dependencies, that you must make sure you have installed:
C-devel, X11-devel, ncurses, ncurses-devel and crypt libraries.
The package names are usually:
build-essential, xorg-dev, libncurses5, libncurses5-dev, libgcrypt11,
libc6-dev.

Since version 4.4.5 which supports music and sound via SDL, you also need
libsdl-mixer-devel, libsdl, libsmpeg. Usual package names (SDL version 1.2):
libsdl-mixer1.2, libsdl-mixer1.2-dev, libsdl1.2debian, libsdl1.2-dev,
(preferably libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio, eg under Ubuntu), libsmpeg0,
libsmpeg-dev.
If you don't want to use audio, edit the makefile and compare the two
paragraphs titled 'Without SDL' and 'With SDL' and edit the makefile
accordingly, to compile it without SDL audio support.
NOTE: If you are compiling the above packages yourself, make sure that you
install the specific audio format libs (smpeg, ogg..) _before_ you install
libsdl-mixer, so its configure script will recognize those formats and enable
support for the according file types.

Enter these two lines:
        make clean
        make tomenet
and the binary 'tomenet' will be created in this folder 'tomenet/src'.
IMPORTANT NOW: You need to move the binary 'tomenet' that was just created one
               level upwards, so it's placed in the 'tomenet/' folder!
Go up one level into your 'tomenet/' folder. There type:
        ./tomenet
to start the game.


Configure TomeNET on Linux by editing config files or setting environment vars:
(This is not really required. Most things can be configured by in-game menus or
by dragging/positioning the game windows with the mouse.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To configure which windows are visible and what font they use and all sorts of
other options, edit the file ".tomenetrc" which should be in your home folder
(or specify alternative location via -f command-line option, see below).

Note: If the game client's positioning of windows doesn't work on your system,
you can use other means such as KDE's native window positioning (right-click
the windows and modify the "special window settings" or "special application
settings") or the tool Devilspie (should be in your default repository) if
you're on Gnome or Xfce or anything else. 'gdevilspie' may also be available,
which is a graphical version of devilspie.

Alternatively to using the .tomenetrc file for window configuration, you can
also set environment variables. These settings will override .tomenetrc:
TOMENET_X11_FONT_SCREEN (height and width of main window cannot be changed)
TOMENET_X11_WID_MIRROR, TOMENET_X11_HGT_MIRROR, TOMENET_X11_FONT_MIRROR
TOMENET_X11_WID_CHOICE, TOMENET_X11_HGT_CHOICE, TOMENET_X11_FONT_CHOICE
TOMENET_X11_WID_RECALL, TOMENET_X11_HGT_RECALL, TOMENET_X11_FONT_RECALL
TOMENET_X11_WID_TERM_4, TOMENET_X11_HGT_TERM_4, TOMENET_X11_FONT_TERM_4
TOMENET_X11_WID_TERM_5, TOMENET_X11_HGT_TERM_5, TOMENET_X11_FONT_TERM_5
TOMENET_X11_WID_TERM_6, TOMENET_X11_HGT_TERM_6, TOMENET_X11_FONT_TERM_6
TOMENET_X11_WID_TERM_7, TOMENET_X11_HGT_TERM_7, TOMENET_X11_FONT_TERM_7
Use the 'export' command to set them, eg:
        export TOMENET_X11_FONT_SCREEN=8x13
        export TOMENET_X11_WID_TERM_4=80
        export TOMENET_X11_HGT_TERM_4=24
TOMENET_X11_FONT sets one font globally for all windows. It's overridden by
the window-specific font variables listed above though.
Depending on your system, some possible fonts are usually:
4x6, 5x7, 5x8, 6x9, 6x10, 6x12, 7x13, 7x14, 8x13, 9x15, 10x20, 12x24.

Last but not least, you may use the following command-line options:
-c                      force command-line interface instead of X11 etc.
                        Use it if you want to run the client within a terminal.
-e                      Create file 'tomenet.log' instead of displaying
                        error messages in the terminal
-f<config file>         use a different config file than ~/.tomenetrc
-i                      ignore the ~/.tomenetrc config file
-l<Account> <Password>  for example -lGandalf geheim
-m                      skip motd (message of the day) on login
-N<character name>      for example -NDruidor
-p<Port>                for example -p19348
<ip address>            for example 37.187.75.24
-q                      turns off loading/initializing of audio ('quiet mode')
-u                      disables automatic LUA script updating
                        (You should NOT use this option!)
-v                      automatically save chat log on exit
-w                      disables weather effects

Full command-line example:
        ./tomenet -p19348 -lGandalf geheim -NGandalf 37.187.75.24

If your name contains spaces, it is neccessary to put a '\' in front of each.
Example:
        ./tomenet -p18348 -lIron\ Man geheimer 37.187.75.24
..if your account name is 'Iron Man'.

(Skip down to (2.1a) to continue reading.)


Mac OS X (using pre-compiled binary; tested with Snow Leopard 10.6.6):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the file 'TomeNET.run' to start the game.

If you're tech savvy and want to manually edit the TomeNET configuration file,
see "Configure TomeNET on Linux" further above.

Otherwise skip down to (2.1a) to continue reading.


Mac OS X (compiling from source; tested with Snow Leopard 10.6.6):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically use the same instructions as for Linux above. Additionally:

-To actually install gcc you will need to install the 'xcode' package, which
 contains gcc. Download the correct xcode version for your Mac OS X version
 from developer.apple.com. For this you will first need to create a developer
 account (choose the free account version of course).

-Download the required packages (tar.gz/tar.bz2 files from ftp.gnupg.org,
 ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu and www.libsdl.org) listed in the Linux installation
 instructions above and extract, compile and install them each via the usual
   ./configure
   make clean
   make
   sudo make install
 command chain from a terminal window.
 Note: libsdl_mixer can be found on www.libsdl.org too, by clicking on the
 "Libraries" menu and searching for "mixer".

 If you have trouble installing those source packages, you could try to simply
 use MacPorts to fetch them, at http://www.macports.org/.

Dependencies:
-libgcrypt depends on libgpg-error, which you will need to install too.
-libsdl_mixer may complain about missing dependencies (at least Ogg Vorbis is
 required for TomeNET, since it's the official audio format - the rest is only
 needed if you add custom audio files in the according file formats):
  -Ogg Vorbis library (www.xiph.org -> libogg and libvorbis) for OGG file
   support, which is what the official TomeNET audio files are.
  -SMPEG library (icculus.org/smpeg) for MP3 file support. (libsdl_mixer's
   configure script May also list additional notes regarding the environment
   variable SMPEG_CONFIG, don't miss them.)
  -MikMod library (mikmod.raphnet.net) for various module music support.
  -FLAC library (flac.sourceforge.net) for FLAC file support.

-If you mess with compiler-related environment variables and paths and for
 whatever reason get a 'compiler cannot create executables' error when trying
 to ./configure packages, just close the terminal and re-open it, to reset all
 vars.

It is recommended to use the makefile called 'makefile.osx' for compiling.
If for whatever reason you try to use an unmodified Linux makefile to compile
then you might run into the following problems:

-ncurses starts hiding some internal properties at v5.7+ which causes a
 dereference error when trying to compile main-gcu.c. This seems to be a
 Mac OS X specific problem since only the ncurses shipping with Snow Leopard
 has NCURSES_OPAQUE set to 1 while the Linux version has not.
 To fix it, add
   -DNCURSES_OPAQUE=0
 to CFLAGS compiler options in the makefile.

-For preprocessing LUA files the 'cpp' variant does not work, the 'gcc' variant
 must be used instead: Edit the makefile, locate 'cpp' and comment out the two
 cpp-related lines and uncomment the two gcc-related lines, if it's not already
 like that by default.

-If the LIBS linker flags in the makefile say '-lcrypt' that will cause an
 error about library not being found. Change it to '-lgcrypt' to fix it.

-If the LDFLAGS are empty the linker will throw a not-found error 22. Fix this
 by moving (or copying) the -L... library search-folder parameters from LIBS to
 LDFLAGS so it contains all lib paths.


Configure TomeNET on Mac OS X:
------------------------------
Most things can be configured by in-game menus or by dragging/positioning the
game windows with the mouse, and do not require manual editing.

See 'Configure TomeNET on Linux' above, it's basically the same.
Mac OS X also uses the ".tomenetrc" configuration file which should be in your
home folder, same as Linux.


TomeNET on FreeBSD:
-------------------
Should be same as on Linux, except that the "8x13" standard font might not get
found, preventing TomeNET from starting. A fix according to "N der Fuenfte":
  root% cd /usr/ports/x11-fonts/xorg-fonts
  root% make install clean
  root% # restart X server, if in doubt, just reboot PC.


(2.1a) Installing sound and music packs
---------------------------------------
Starting with version 4.4.5, TomeNET features a new SDL-based audio system,
which provides sound effects and background music.

To make use of it, all you have to do is download a sound and/or music pack and
then install it. For downloading, go to www.tomenet.eu and then click on
'Downloads'.
Read on for instructions how to install those once you downloaded them. There
are two ways, automatically (client does it for you) and manually (you unzip
them to the correct location yourself):


a) Automatic audio pack installation
------------------------------------
(See paragraph above for where to download audio packs.)
Starting with client version 4.4.9, there is an automatic installer for sound
and music pack:

Step 1:
 WINDOWS/OSX:
 Make sure you have 7zip installed. It's a free, powerful multi-platform
 archiving tool (fit to replace WinRAR, WinZip etc).
 Get it from www.7-zip.org.

 LINUX:
 Make sure you have 7zip installed. The package name is p7zip.
 Note that some Linux distributions (Ubuntu) have another package called
 p7zip-full and the package p7zip is lacking certain parts. In that case
 install p7zip-full.
 UPDATE: Ubuntu seems to no longer provide the graphical user interface of 7zip
 7zG in either of these packages, so you'll have to download the source instead
 directly from the project page (on sourceforge) and compile it yourself:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/files/p7zip/
  pick the folder with the latest version and download the 'src_all' source
  archive, not the 'linux_bin' binary archive (it doesn't contain 7zG!).
 Short compilation/installation instructions:
  Extract the source archive and enter its directory.
  For 32-bit Linux, do:
   cp makefile.linux_x86_asm_gcc_4.X makefile.machine
  For 64-bit Linux, instead do:
   cp makefile.linux_amd64_asm makefile.machine
  Then do:
   make all4
  And last but not least:
   sudo make install
  That's it. Try entering '7zG' into the terminal to verify that it worked.

Step 2:
 Download the files 'TomeNET-soundpack.7z' and/or 'TomeNET-musicpack.7z' and
 put them into your TomeNET folder. The automatic installation only recognizes
 these two file names. If you download audio packs that are named differently,
 simply rename them before attempting to auto-install them.

Step 3:
 Launch the game, press '=' to enter the configuration menu, and press 'I' to
 invoke the auto-installer.

Step 4:
 After it's done it should tell you to restart your client. (You might also
 get disconnected automatically, if the auto-installation takes a while. That
 is fine.) Just restart the game and press CTRL+U to look at the audio mixer
 (or CTRL+F if you're using rogue-like key map).
 It should tell you that sound and/or music pack have been installed.

In case you want to install the packs manually instead of using auto-install,
read on.


b) Manual audio pack installation
---------------------------------
(See first paragraph of (2.1a) above for where to download audio packs.)
Instead of automatic installation explained above you can also just manually
unpack audio packs to your TomeNET/lib/xtra/ folder. Make sure the game isn't
running while you do.

Note: Some people have reported that the program 'WinRAR' seems to cause
      problems in some cases, giving them "file corrupted" errors.
      This might also happen with WinZIP, but we don't know really.
      A powerful free and open source program that is guaranteed to work is
      '7zip' (a sourceforge project at the time of writing) downloadable at:
      http://www.7-zip.org/

You can get the official sound pack on http://www.tomenet.eu/ in the download
section, and also look for player-made sound or music packs in the forum!

On Microsoft Windows, the easiest way to do this after you downloaded a sound
or music zip file is to:
------------------------
1. install 7zip, a free zip/unzip tool, if you haven't installed one already.
2. open a Windows Explorer window and navigate to your TomeNET folder. Then
   double-click the 'lib' folder to enter it. You should now now see a folder
   named 'xtra' being shown.
3. quit TomeNET if it's still running, just to be on the safe side (sometimes
   MS Windows may prevent files from getting overwritten if they are still in
   use by a running program).
4. double-click your downloaded sound or music pack zip file to open it in 7zip
   or whatever you use, and its contents should be displayed:
   Either a folder named 'sound' or a folder named 'music', depending on what
   kind of pack you just downloaded.
   Use the mouse to drag that 'sound' or 'music' folder over to the Windows
   Explorer window you prepared, right onto the 'xtra' folder, and let go.
   7zip will now extract the sound or music folder into the xtra folder (while
   preserving the path structure).
   If you were extracting a sound pack or if you already installed a music pack
   previously then you will be prompted to overwrite files - choose "yes".
   Wait for the extraction process to finish.
5. Start or restart TomeNET and press CTRL+U (or CTRL+F on rogue-like key map)
   in the game to view the audio mixer screen. If everything went smoothly it
   should say that a sound or a music pack or both have been found.
   If you don't have sound, make sure that your TomeNET.ini file (it's in your
   TomeNET folder, double-click it to view, can be opened with any normal text
   editor) says 'Sound=1' which it should by default if you haven't modified it
   earlier.

Alternative instructions (Linux/Mac OS X/in general):
-----------------------------------------------------
After you downloaded a sound pack or a music pack, extract it to your lib/xtra/
folder, preserving the archive pathname structure. You should end up with a
folder lib/xtra/sound/ and lib/xtra/music/ respectively, which contain config
files and further subfolders for either sound effects or background music.

Important: If you extract it via command-line via '7z' command, make sure to
use '7z x ...' and not '7z e ...'! x will extract with correct path names.

Now start or restart the game, and you should have sound.
If you don't have sound, press CTRL+U for audio mixer (or CTRL+F if you're
using rogue-like key map):
It should say that sound and music pack have been detected if everything went
alright, otherwise you see a red error message.
Also verify  that your config file ("TomeNET.ini" on MS Windows, ".tomenetrc"
in your home folder on Linux or Mac OS X) has 'Sound' set to '1'.


(2.1b) Audio controls and config options
----------------------------------------
You can control mixer settings with CTRL+U key on normal keymap and CTRL+F on
rogue-like key map (or use CTRL+C to toggle music and CTRL+N to toggle the
master mixer on/off, CTRL+V instead of CTRL+N on rogue-like key map).

Note: Mixer settings are saved automatically, provided you use CTRL+Q to quit.
(Compare troubleshooting section (8.8), problem 21.)

Also be sure to press '=' key to have a look at the audio options.

If you want to temporarily disable all loading/initializing of audio then
instead of editing the config file's 'Sound' entry you can just use the '-q'
command-line option.

If you want to use your own sound and music, and create audio packs for other
players, read (2.1b) below.


(2.1c) Manually editing sound and music configuration
-----------------------------------------------------
You can easily replace or disable certain sound effects or music, or even
create your own sound and music packs.

All audio files are in the sub-folders 'sound' and 'music' in the folder
TomeNET/lib/xtra/. You can just delete or replace the sound files and it'll
apply as soon as you start/restart the game. To convert your own sound files
to the appropriate format of already existing files, when you overwrite them,
use an audio editor, for example:

'Goldwave' is a good sound editor for Windows OS, which is free to use
  (although it asks for registration, but that's just optional.)
Alternatively, the free open source audio editor 'Audacity' is available
  for Linux, OSX and Windows.

For more specific editing, open the files 'sound.cfg' (in the sound folder) or
'music.cfg' (in the music folder, if a music pack has been installed) in any
text editor that supports unix line breaks (Notepad++ for example) and start
fine-tuning your audio. Both cfg files actually begin with some instructions
on what file types are supported and about the structure of the files aka how
to modify/add entries correctly.

For example if you want to disable a certain sound effect temporarily, open
sound.cfg in your text editor, locate the sound effect, and just put a ';'
symbol at the beginning of the line - that will effectively disable the whole
line. (Of course you could also just rename the actual sound file instead of
editing the cfg file; that way it cannot be loaded by the game anymore.
However, you shouldn't use '#' to disable sounds, because this might make the
server think that you are using an outdated audio pack and send you wrong
audio codes, resulting in hearing the wrong music in a particular dungeon for
example. So it's preferable to use ';' to disable songs or sound effects.)

If you want to edit sound or music configuration files in detail, you will
probably be starting off in one of these two situations:

A) You already have the official sound/music packs installed.

   In this case you can just happily edit the files sound.cfg and music.cfg
   (found in sub-folder TomeNET/lib/xtra/sound and TomeNET/lib/xtra/music
   respectively) if you want to change the actual filenames.

B) You have no packs installed. In this case, you will have pretty bare example
   configuration files in these two folders mentioned in 'A)', which are named
   sound.cfg.default and music.cfg.default.
   What you have to do in this case is:
   1) Do not edit these default files. Instead, make a copy of each, and call
      those copies 'sound.cfg' and 'music.cfg' respectively, and edit these!
   2) Since they're still pretty empty, you will have no ideas of the sound and
      music event names, save for the sound effects 'page', 'warning' and
      'greeting' which are specified by default.
      So to find out all the other event names, open the file 'audio.lua' in
      any text editor. This file is found in folder TomeNET/lib/scpt/.
      Now you can just add new lines to your sound.cfg and music.cfg files
      using the event names you see in audio.lua, in the same manner as the
      three already existing entries in sound.cfg.

      MAKE SURE you read the instructions written in the beginning of the files
      sound.cfg and music.cfg. They also tell you which audio formats you can
      use.

Note: Do not MODIFY the file audio.lua, it has nothing to do with editing your
      sound or music. Don't worry though if you accidentally modified it, it'll
      be automatically restored next time you log on to the server.


(2.1d) "Promoting" TomeNET on Steam ;)
--------------------------------------
In Steam's "Games" menu choose "Add a non-Steam game to my library".
Browse for the TomeNET.exe file and check it.
Click on "Add selected programs".

Now you can start TomeNET from your Steam library of games like any other game,
and if you do so then your Steam status will show that you are playing TomeNET!



(2.2) Starting TomeNET and getting to play on an internet server
----------------------------------------------------------------
To start the TomeNET client, run 'TomeNET.exe' or 'TomeNET-direct.bat'.
(If you run the '.bat' file, the meta-server steps will be skipped and you
will be directly connected to the official main server instead.)
Now TomeNET tries to connect to a meta-server which contains a list of all
available TomeNET internet servers.
After the meta-server has been queried, the list of available servers will
appear in the main window. Choose a server that is near to your location to
avoid high latency.
(This step is reported to sometimes cause problems on Windows OS. If you don't
see that list, or if other problems occur, see (8.8) for possible solutions.)

Now you will be prompted to enter your account name and password. You can
choose these freely, the server will save that information and use it to
remember which characters belonged to you the next time you log on.
IMPORTANT: If you get kicked out with an error message after entering account
and password, it's likely because that account name is already in use by
someone else so your password was recognized as 'incorrect' since it was most
likely different from that user's password. Just try a different account name.
A player usually has exactly one account that can hold up to 8 characters.
In most cases newly created accounts have to be "validated" by a server
administrator to enable you to use the whole functionality of TomeNET. For
example it is common not to allow unvalidated players to drop items or money
to the ground. This is done to prevent certain cases of abuse.
If you accidentally chose an account name or character name which was already
taken by another player, you will be disconnected with an error message. In
that case, try again with different names.

Now that you have logged in you can create a new player character which will
represent you in the virtual world of Middle Earth!
To do so, press 'N' key in your character overview screen (showing you empty
character slots, since you haven't created any characters yet) and then enter
a name for your character. You may use the same name as your account name, if
you like.
Players logged on to the game are identified by 3 names:
-Nickname (character's name)
-Realname (account name)
-Hostname (The hostname of the connecting computer)
The hostname is not really important. However, make sure that all of these 3
names may only consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and all other characters
with an ASCII code between 32 (SPACE) and 122 ('z').
The realname and hostname must not be empty. The nickname (character name)
needs to start with a letter ('A'..'Z' or 'a'..'z').

Newly created accounts are marked as 'not yet validated' and have certain
limitations, which are:
Cannot drop items or chat privately with other players, or advance beyond a
certain level.
You will need an admin to 'validate' your account.
Usually, all you have to do is to keep playing/stay online for a bit until an
admin logs in, notices that you are new, and validates your account.
If that doesn't seem to happen, ask an admin directly, when you see one
chatting (Admin's names are displayed in dark blue in the chat).
If the server's intro screen mentions to send an email to an admin, try that
and specify your account name in it.

You may continue reading at (3.1), which explains details of the character
creation progress.



(2.3) Client options
--------------------
By pressing the '=' key in game, you can access the options menu where you can
tweak your client in some ways. Some of these options that aren't
self-explaining or that are especially important are listed in detail here:

 (1, 2, 3) User Interface Options
    Rogue-like commands (rogue_like_commands)
        Toggles between normal key set and traditional rogue-like key set.

    Double height of the map shown in the main window (big_map)
        Definitely enable this to see if you prefer it: It doubles the size of
        the game-play area displayed in the main window.

    Suppress server messages as far as possible (taciturn_messages)
        Will prevent some of the not-so-important server messages to be
        shown, for example 'You have <item>' when picking up an item.

    Don't display 'flavours' in item names (short_item_names)
        A 'Black Potion of Speed' will just be shown as a 'Potion of Speed'.

    Show experience bar instead of a number (exp_bar)
        In the main window at the 'XP' label your experience is displayed as a
        progress bar instead of showing the numerical value, much like in
        common MMORPGs where each bar segment is often referred to as 'bubble'.

        This bar has a resolution of 5% steps and displays..
          a dark blue '#' to indicate 5%,
          a light blue '#' to indicate 10%,
          a full bar of dark blue '#' to indicate 95%+.

        This is especially recommended for high-level characters who require
        several dungeon dives to gain a level-up. This way, you can keep track
        of your progress during the current dive, eg "I want to make at least
        30% experience progress (aka '3 bubbles') before I recall out of this
        dungeon".

        Examples for the bar (dark blue '#' are written as '+' here just for
        illustration purpose):
        ---------   You have made less than 5% XP since your last level-up.
        ###------   You already made 30% (or a bit more) XP this level.
        ####+----   You made 45% (or a bit more) XP towards next level already.
        +++++++++   You have 95% (or up to 99%) XP and are therefore very close
                    to level-up! Might just as well keep diving till ding! :-p

    Hide unusable skills (hide_unusable_skills)
        Skills that your character cannot use will not be displayed in the
        skill menu invoked by 'G' key.

    Flash own character icon after far relocation (flash_player)
        Whenever your character teleports, recalls, takes a void jump gate or
        phases in such a way that your current view panel changes, your
        character icon will flash quickly and brightly for a moment, to help
        your eyes ascertain your position.
        Useful for example if there are many monsters around and you're a
        mimic in monster form, or just in general when you're in big_map mode.

    Alert on taking damage while you are AFK (alert_afk_dam) and
    alert on taking damage while looking around the map via 'locate' command
    (alert_offpanel_dam). (The locate command is invoked with SHIFT+L on normal
    key map and SHIFT+W on rogue-like key map.)

    A bunch of options for special visual effects and lighting.
        These options change how lighting is applied to lamp light and walls,
        lamp light colour and how walls are displayed depending on the font:

        font_map_solid_walls (depending on font displays walls as solid blocks)
        view_animated_lite (fire-based light sources flicker yellow-orange)

        wall_lighting (generally enables lighting/shading fx for walls:)
        view_lamp_walls (your light source lights up certain wall grids)
        view_shade_walls (darkens wall grids out of sight)

        floor_lighting (generally enables lighting/shading fx for floors:)
        view_lamp_floor (your light source lights up certain floor grids)
        view_shade_floor (darkens floor grids out of sight)

        view_lite_extra (lights up a few additional wall/floor types)

 (4) Audio Options
    (See (2.1a) for more information about sound and music.)

    A bunch of stuff here, mostly you might want to look at attack-sound effect
    frequency. Some people don't like to have those be played on each single
    attack, so you can tweak them here.

    no_shriek_sfx and no_house_sfx might be especially interesting too.

 (5, 6) Game-Play Options
    Use old target by default (use_old_target)
        If this is on, a ranged attack via *t5 or *t- will not pick a new
        (ie closer) target if the previously acquired target is still okay.

    Set 'AFK mode' automatically (auto_afk)

    Prevent floating for a short while after death (safe_float)
        For a few turns after your character dies you cannot float up or down
        with the '<' or '>' key. This prevents accidentally leaving the floor
        in case you were just trying to take a staircase right the moment you
        died, which would result in losing your items since the dungeon level
        would probably regenerate if you left it.

    Abort macro execution if an action fails (safe_macros)
        If any sub-action in a macro you execute fails then the whole macro/key
        queue will be discarded and cleared.
        This is useful if you for example have a spellcasting macro that would
        just do something weird in case you lost the according spell book and
        then tried to cast it anyway, accidentally.
        This only affects magic spells and monster traps.

    Automatically open doors (easy_open)
        Your character attempts to open a door just by you moving into it.

    Clear @-inscriptions on taking item ownership (clear_inscr)
        When you pick up items that belonged to another player, any '@...'
        inscriptions will be rendered effectless by replacing the @ by a space.
        This is a security feature that is intended to prevent the inscriptions
        from interfering with the inscriptions on your own items.
        For example, your potions of healing might be inscribed @q1. If you now
        pick up a potion of heroism that someone else also inscribed @q1, it
        will be used the next time you press your 'q1' macro, because heroism
        potions are sorted in in the inventory before healing potions, which
        might cost your life if unlucky.
        Alternatively if you have this option turned off, you can just use the
        '}' key to uninscribe the items you get from someone else.

    Use additional predefined auto-inscriptions (auto_inscribe)
        Will provide a predefined (on server-side) set of item-inscriptions
        that will be applied automatically to some selected items, which are
        Word of Recall items, various scrolls and a few potions.
        (These inscriptions are applied independantly of the custom auto
        inscription feature you can access with '&' key.)
        The server-side auto-inscriptions are currently:
            Scrolls of Phase Door:      @r1
            Scrolls of Teleportation:   @r2
            Scrolls of Word of Recall:  @r3@R
            Rods of Recall:             @z3@R
            Scrolls of Identify:        @r5!X
            Scrolls of Trap Detection:  @r8
            Scrolls of Magic Mapping:   @r9
            Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger:  @r0
            Potions of Healing:         @q1
            Potions of Speed:           @q2
            Potions of Resistance:      @q3
            Potions of Restore-L-Lev:   @q4
        Note: Already inscribed items are not touched.

    Thin down screen flush signals to avoid freezing (thin_down_flush)
        Enabled by default, this discards all 9 of every 10 flush signals, so
        it reduces the animation delays to 10%.
        See below for an explanation of flush signals.

    Disable delays from flush signals (disable_flush)
        Completely disables the delay flush signals cause. Flush signals are
        signals sent by the server to make the client wait for 1 ms, which is
        used mainly to draw animations when casting spells or shooting,
        like the arrow flying or the balls of explosions.
        If you have a slow network or are lagging a lot, you may try to disable
        this. Certain animations might visually suffer from doing so.

    Scroll the screen more frequently (wide_scroll_margin)
        Should always be enabled! Will reduce probability for off-screen kills,
        since the screen scrolls much earlier when you come close to a border!

    Get kicked out automatically by the game when starving and idle for 30
        seconds. (idle_starve_kick)

 (8) Check Server Options
    Displays a list of the server rules and configuration.

 (A) Account options
    Here you can see if your account is valid. Invalid accounts are also
    indicated by a yellow 'I' in the players list you get with '@' key.
    Also, you can change your password here!

 (W) Window flags
    Here you can configure each of the program windows in detail.
    It is recommended that you have one dedicated window for 'Display chat',
    so you don't miss important messages during combat.


(2.3a) Client options configuration files
-----------------------------------------
Don't forget to save options to a file after you changed them, so the change
becomes persistent and will be remembered next time you log on.
The following files will be automatically processed by TomeNET:

global.opt                      global client options, will be loaded on all
                                characters

global-<operating system>.opt   client options for specific OS, can be used to
                                have different options depending on whether
                                a Linux client is running in X11 mode or as
                                GCU terminal application. The file names would
                                be global-x11.opt and global-gcu.opt.

<character name>.opt            client options file that will be loaded for a
                                particularly named character only, if you log
                                on with it, eg "Gandalf.opt".



(2.4) Installing voice chat
---------------------------
While chatting in TomeNET is usually fine to communicate with other players and
party members in particular, using a real voice chat via headset (headphones +
microphone) can be much more effective, easier and more fun.

To support voice chat, there is actually an official TomeNET 'Mumble' server
running, Mumble being the name of the voice chat software. (The server part is
actually called Murmur, Mumble is the name of the client part and the project
name in general.)

Mumble provides excellent voice quality at low bandwith usage, and is a free
open source program, hence it is free of charge (both server and client).
It also allows sending text messages in case you don't have a microphone, those
can be automatically converted to speech, which is then read to the receipient.
(This feature can be turned off in the menu 'Configure' -> 'Text-To-Speech'.)
And same as Ventrilo or Teamspeak, Mumble allows for custom channel structures.
Mumble is available for all major platforms, ie Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

Instructions to join the TomeNET Mumble server for voice chatting:
-Plug in a headset.
-Download the Mumble client from http://mumble.sourceforge.net/ and install it.
 NOTE: If you are looking for the Linux version, it should be in your package
 repository. No need to visit the sourceforge project website in this case.
-Go through the audio configuration (Audio Wizard) and possibly set up a key to
 push when you want your voice to be transmitted (or just select voice-
 activation, which will automatically transmit your voice when you speak).
-Go to menu 'Server' -> 'Connect' -> 'Add New..'
 and enter this server information to add the official TomeNET Mumble server:
 Label:     Choose any name you like, eg "TomeNET Voice Chat".
 Adress:    europe.tomenet.eu
 Port:      23348
 Username:  Choose any name you like, it's your nickname on the Mumble server.
 Click 'Ok', select the newly added server in the list and click 'Connect'.

That's it. To change to a certain chat channel, simply double-click it.
You can only hear people in the same chat channel (or in a parent channel).


Troubleshooting Mumble:
-----------------------
PROBLEM:  You could connect fine, but after reinstalling Mumble you cannot
          connect anymore.
SOLUTION: Go to "Settings" -> "Certificate Wizard", create a new certificate.

PROBLEM:  You get a message "the remote host closed the connection".
SOLUTION: Can be caused by some firewalls interacting with mumble's quality of
          service optimizations. You can disable QOS in mumble:
          Windows/Linux:
           -click "Configure" -> "Settings".
           -look down to the bottom left corner and activate "Advanced".
           -click on "Network" on the left side panel.
           -deactivate/uncheck "Use Quality of Service".
          OS X:
           -in the top menu bar click "Mumble" -> "Preferences".
           -look up to the top right corner and activate "Advanced".
           -click on "Network" tab.
           -deactivate/uncheck "Use Quality of Service".



(2.5) Fonts
-----------
The Windows client comes with a few default fonts of different size, located
in folder lib/xtra/font.
If you aren't happy with the text size in the game, try switching the fonts
used for the main window and the other subwindows: Press '=' to enter the
options menu. Now you can either press 'f' for the fonts menu where you can
change all fonts in detail, or you can hit 'c' to automatically cycle through
predefined font sizes for all windows at once. (You could also enter them
directly in your TomeNET.ini config file, if you wanted. This is obviously the
least flexible solution though.)

Fonts can also be pseudo-graphical, some such fonts might come shipped with the
client. Again press = f and then use + and - keys to switch the main window
font. These two keys allow you to switch through all fonts available in the
lib/xtra/font folder.


For the Linux/OSX client, the game doesn't use the lib/xtra/font folder but
instead assumes that some standard fonts are provided by your system and tries
to select those when cycling with 'c' key in the fonts menu.
You can also set fonts manually with = f if you want to choose specific fonts
available in your Linux/OSX installation.


(2.5a) Custom fonts
-------------------
For the Windows client it is possible to create your own custom fonts for the
game. You can use "Fony" for example: http://hukka.ncn.fi/?fony
(Up to client 4.6.1a it was not possible to use characters of numbers 128-255
but this has been addressed, so the full range of characters is available now.)

Since you might need/want to use mapping files to remap terrain features to the
characters in your font, you can create font-preference files that contain
mapping information.
The default font mapping file is lib/user/font-win.prf. If it exists, this file
will automatically be loaded by the game client.
However, the client first checks for the existance of a specific, custom font
mapping file that has a filename: lib/user/font-custom-FONTNAME.prf and loads
this instead of attempting to load font-win.prf.
This allows you to have a custom mapping file for each of your fonts.

Example:
You go to the fonts menu by pressing = f and switch to a font named 10X16X.FON.
Now the client will automatically try to not only load the font from the font
folder lib/xtra/font/10X16X.FON but also a mapping file to go with it, named
lib/user/font-custom-10X16X.prf.
(On switching fonts, the client will automatically discard all mapping info it
loaded for the previously used font.)

Note that this mapping file loading only happens if you switch the font for the
main window, not when you switch fonts of the subwindows.

Font mapping files have the following syntax for mapping lines:
  F:index:attribute/character
  R:index:attribute/character
with 'attribute' and 'character' being optional.

F-lines:
The 'F' stands for 'feature', meaning a specific terrain tile such as floors,
walls, doors. You can see all of these in the file lib/game/f_info.txt, the
index of each feature is the number located right after 'N:'.

R-lines:
The 'R' stands for 'monster', meaning a specific base monster type. You can see
all of these in the client's in-game monster lore (~7) or in the spoiler file
lib/game/r_info.txt. The monster index is the number located right after 'N:'.

These mapping lines will remap the specified feature or monster to the symbol
with the number 'character' in your font, which may range from 0 to 255, and
display it in the colour 'attribute' which may range from 0 to 55 (up to 4.6.1a
client) or 57 (in later clients), with colours 0 to 15 being static colours and
the higher ones being animated.

Problems have been reported for mapping characters 2 and 16 to 27, there is
currently no further information available regarding this issue. If those don't
work for you, just pick different ones.

Examples:

  F:56:2/127
Maps the terrain feature 'granite wall' (#56 in f_info.txt) to the font symbol
#127 and the colour 2 (which is 'slate').

  R:862:/255
Maps the monster 'Morgoth, Lord of Darkness' (#862 in r_info.txt and in ~6) to
the font symbol #255, leaving its colour at its normal value (the one given in
r_info.txt) without changing it.

When using a custom font you probably want to turn off the option
'font_map_solid_walls' in = 1, as it interferes with the mapping of various
wall tiles: It will force-remap all affected wall tiles to character 127 for
Windows clients and to character 1 for Linux/OSX clients and all treasure veins
('*' symbol in the game, aka walls with treasure to mine) to character 1.


Here is a list of all supported colours:
----------------------------------------
Static colours:
 0  black           1  white           2  slate           3  orange
 4  red             5  green           6  blue            7  umber
 8  dark grey       9  light grey     10  violet         11  yellow
12  light red      13  light green    14  light blue     15  light umber
Animated (flickering in multiple hues) colours:
16  multi          17  poison         18  fire           19  cold
20  acid           21  electricity    22  confusion      23  sound
24  shards         25  light          26  darkness       27  mana-shield
28  invulnerable   29  curse          30  annihilation   31  half-multi

For the Linux/OSX client you'll need to either convert FON fonts to PCF format
(bitmap font files) or create fonts directly in PCF format.
Add them to your system with the usual font-adding procedures for your specific
Linux distribution, then you can select them in TomeNET via  = f  (or enter
them directly in your .tomenetrc config file).



(3) Creating a character & starting to play
===========================================

(3.1) Creating a new character; character modes
-----------------------------------------------
During the character creation process you will be asked about details on the
character and after you have completed it you will start out in the first town,
called Bree.

To create a new character, you press either 'N' or 'E' key in your account
overview screen. 'N' is the normal way for creating a new character.

'E' is for creating a so-called 'exclusive' (or 'dedicated') character:
There are two character slots in your account that can be used for creating a
character dedicated to each of these special ways of playing:
 a) Ironman Deep Dive Challenge (IDDC, see (4.13) for details)
 b) Player versus Player (see 'PvP' further below in this section)
If you create such an exclusive character, you will be unable to use it for
anything else. The point of having exclusive character slots is to ensure that
even if your account is full of characters, you still have one slot available
to participate in IDDC and in PvP gameplay.
Note: A dedicated IDDC character will be killed and erased if it fails to enter
the IDDC dungeon (that is if it acquires any experience outside of it) or if it
recalls out of it at one of the static towns. The kill message will be:
"XXXX was killed by indetermination".

If you have already created a character of the same name before, you will be
given the 'reincarnate' option in every stage of character creation, which
allows you to just press the '#' key to make the same choices that you did on
your previous character of that name.

However, since this is your first character, just press 'N' to start the
creation progress, enter a character name, and continue reading.


First you may choose your gender. This will not have actual influence on your
strengths or weaknesses.


Next you have to choose your class. Spellcasters like Istari or Shamans are
physically weaker and especially hard to play for beginners.
If you choose a spellcaster, be aware that his casting ability depends on
either his intelligence or his wisdom, depending on the actual class. For more
information about classes and their pros and cons see (6.5).
Spellcasting involves using 'macros' (see (3.6)) and might be a bit difficult
for beginners.


 ---- PLEASE NOTE: ----
 If you are new to the game, it is NOT recommended to choose one of these:
 Istar, Priest, Shaman, Adventurer.
 The reason is that these classes are hard to play in the beginning -
 compare introductory explanation in (6.5)!


Then you have to choose your race. Humans are good allrounders, while the other
races are more or less specialized. For example half-trolls are usually quite
dumb but very strong, and hobbits are quite nimble and intelligent but not
very strong. For more information about races see (6.4).
A half-troll warrior might be the best choice for a beginner to try since he
is tough and has less chance of dying instantly in case you make a more
serious mistake. Also you don't have to worry about the spell-casting system
for now.
Note that the availability of various races will depend on the class you chose,
some class-race combinations are not possible.


Now you will see your six basic attributes STRength, INTelligence, WISdom,
DEXterity, CONstitution, CHaRisma.
IMPORTANT NOTE: For fighters (rogues also belong to these, ie all characters
that rely on close combat) that use weapons, it is important that you have
enough STRength and DEXterity to execute at least two attacks per round, called
bpr (blows per round, see (6.5a)).
Sometimes this requires you to get rid of your initial weapon and buy a very
light weapon, for example one of these:
 -dagger or main gauche (sword class),
 -whip (blunt class),
 -cleaver (axe class) or
 -spear (polearm class).
(For more information about the different weapon classes see (5.1a).)
Sometimes it is even possible to start out with 3 bpr (warriors mostly).

Depending on the server configuration, starting at TomeNET version 4.2.0,
there are 2 alternative stages of character creation that may follow now.

1) The old way - random stats:  (deprecated)
You see the short names for the 6 stats written from the left to the right
on the very bottom of the screen, and you're asked to choose a stat order.
You have to determine how important each of the 6 stats is to you by defining
an order. The first attribute you choose will be raised most.
However, know that all your stats are randomly modified slightly, each
character that you create even with same race and class will be a bit
different. Sometimes you are lucky and get really high attributes at the
beginning. And sometimes you get more gold to start with. If you don't like
the resulting stats after you finished character creation, suicide and start
over.

2) The new way since 4.2.0 - chosen stats:
You see your 6 stats written below each other, followed by a base number (10).
Right above them you see your free points (30) that you may distribute on the
stats. Use the numpad (numlock turned on) to navigate and increase or decrease
your stats until you used up all free points. Hit ESC when you're happy with
your choice.
In general, if you play a character that relies on close combat, try to at
least match the STR and DEX values shown in the table in the column titled
'Min. recommended, if possible'.
If you can do that then you should start with at least 2 bpr with a light
weapon, or even with your starting weapon. If your starting weapon already
gives 2 bpr you could still examine even lighter weapons in stores to find one
that gives you one more bpr i.e. 3 bpr and just discard your starting weapon.

Note: The stat points you distribute have no effect on the maximum value your
character can get by quaffing stat potions. These points to distribute are
basically just "free stat potions".


Now you can choose a difficulty level you wish to play on. Options are
n) Normal  g) no Ghost  H) Hellish  e) Everlasting
It is recommended that you choose either n) to play a normal character or g)
to play a normal character without a ghost.
You can also choose e), that will give your character an infinite amount of
resurrections, while 'normal' characters often have a limited amount of lives
(depending on the server configuration).

Mode: 'Normal'
--------------
A normal character will turn into a ghost if he dies. The ghost can be revived
by either visiting a temple or another living player using a magic scroll of
life when standing adjacent to the ghost. The ghost will return to the world
of living under the cost of a lot of experience but at least the player can
resume playing. If the ghost dies, the character will finally be erased
permanently, watch out!
Depending on the server configuration the number of times a ghost is limited,
standard is 3 lifes.

Mode: 'Everlasting'
-------------------
Create an everlasting character for an infinite amount of resurrections (with
the exception that they too are completely destroyed if they die to insanity.)
Everlasting characters can become king/queen, but cannot enter the high-score.
Other character types cannot use items that belong to everlasting
characters. Exception: Word of Recall scrolls can be exchanged between an
everlasting and a non-everlasting player!
Non-everlasting and everlasting characters can't be in the same party.
If an everlasting King/Queen dies, he won't be destroyed but lose the
King/Queen status. To regain it, he needs to find another player who hasn't
defeated Sauron and Morgoth yet and team up with him, because those two won't
(re)spawn for the everlasting player.
Since it was often asked: Non-everlasting and everlasting players can revive
each other without problems.
Everlasting characters can additionally use the 'Instant Resurrection' feature
offered by town temples, see (4.5a).

Mode: 'Unworldly' (no-ghost)
----------------------------
Unworldly characters are like normal characters, but they have only one life.
So if they die they cannot revive but are completely erased (no ghost will be
created.)
Note: This is the traditional rogue-like gaming mode.

Mode: 'Hellish' (extra hard no-ghost)
-------------------------------------
These are unworldly characters with extra penalties:
-1 point malus on each of the 6 character attributes
-healing is reduced by 25%
-AC is reduced by 50%
-ESP only works within radius of 20 squares
-any speed changes above or below +0 are reduced by 50%
-max number of melee attacks per round is reduced by 1.

Mode: 'PvP'
-----------
This is a special restricted mode that has nothing to do with normal gameplay.
If you're new to the game, it's absolutely not recommended to choose this.
More information about 'PvP' mode is given in (6.13).

Unworldly characters will receive 25% bonus on their high score.
Hellish characters receive 50% bonus on their high score.


Last you can choose a body modification. It's strongly recommended for
beginners to choose 'normal body' and NOT 'fruit bat'. ;)

Body: 'Fruit bat' (Batty)
-------------------------
A fruit bat is like a normal character, just not in humanoid shape but in bat
form! Fruit bats cannot equip weapons, boots or gloves.
These restrictions won't change even if they choose a class which can make use
if mimicry and thereby mimic a humanoid form (druid fruit bats would in fact be
the most ineffective choice).
However, fruit bats are twice as fast as normal characters at the beginning
(they get a flat +10 speed bonus added) and their melee attacks are somewhat
vampiric, making them leech life on each hit, replenishing their hit points.
Fruit bats are said to make good explorers. If you're new to the game, it's
absolutely not recommended to try and play fruit bat.


Note that race and class will have influence on how much experience you will
need to gain a new character level. For example, High-Elves already know a
lot, so experience is hard to gain for them. In fact they will need 130% more
experience than a human.

Creation of your character is now finished and you are asked to press a key to
start the actual game. Do so and take a minute to read the text that will
appear. It is called news or motd (message of the day) and often contains
important server-specific information or announcements to the players.


(3.1a) Character names, collisions and reservations
---------------------------------------------------
You cannot pick names of characters that are already in use by other players or
that are very similar to another player's account name.
However, if your character dies and gets erased, its name will be reserved for
you for 24 hours, allowing you to recreate it if you want to.
Certain swear words are also not allowed in character or account names.
Last but not least you cannot create an account with a name of an existing
character or account of someone else, but your actual account name will at the
same time always be reserved as a character name for you personally, so there
is no need to hurry and create a character of the same name as your account
just to reserve it for you.



(3.2) The display (user-interface)
----------------------------------
After you logged in with a character you will now see yourself (you are the
'@' symbol, except if you chose 'fruit bat' body, then you'll be a 'b')
in the town of Bree in the main window.
You will already have a few basic starter items equipped, so you're mostly
ready to move out. Note that Bree has already two dungeon entrances, one is the
"Training Tower" where you should go first, the other one is "Barrow-Downs",
the first 'real' dungeon. The training tower entrance is a green '<' symbol,
step on it and press the '<' key to enter. To actually locate the entrance you
can use Shift+L which will let you look around the local map. The entrance to
the training tower is somewhat south of your starting position.
Note that the Bree already has some "monsters", well, townspeople, denoted by
the letter 't'. They're all more or less hostile though so don't hesitate to
kill them off for some extra money and beware of mean-looking mercenaries and
battle-scarred veterans since these could make short work of you at level 1.
You could enter some shops (numbers and '+' symbols) and see if you find
anything affordable worth buying, maybe some armour, potions, scrolls or a
brass lantern.

You can move around in all 8 directions by using the number pad keys! You can
run by pressing the SHIFT key together with a direction key.
IMPORTANT: To run (SHIFT+direction) make sure that the Numlock key above your
number key pad on the right side of your keyboard is turned off. A green lamp
will usually indicate whether it is on or off.
Running will not work while awake monsters are in your line of sight, except
for the starting town of Bree, where running is always possible.

You can also use the arrow keys to move, but the numpad is better since it
allows you to move diagonally too, which is very important.

You can wear/wield items with 'w' (weapons, armour, light source..)
You can pickup items with 'g'. Drop items with 'd'. Destroy items with 'k'.
You can see a list of players who are currently online with '@' key. Other
 players eligible to form a party with you have their level displayed in light
 blue colour in this list. Press SHIFT+P to invoke the party menu.
You can chat with other players (say hello ^^) with ':' key.

The top right window will give an overview of your character attributes and
miscellanous abilities. The bottom right window will show the contents of your
backpack, also called inventory. All characters except ghosts have a backpack.
The bottom left window will show combat- chat- and server-messages. If most
of the windows stay totally empty, see (8.8) for possible solutions.
To the left border in the main window you see a short overview of your most
important stats:
-starting with your race
-your class
-your current title
 (the title will change as you gain experience levels by fighting monsters),
-followed by your character level
-your amount of experience
-and your cash ('Au' stands for Aurum, latin for gold)
-the 'encumberment' bar (blank at the beginning)
-a mini lag-o-meter bar displaying your 'ping' by coloured plusses, 1 plus
 symbol means your latency is below 50ms, each further plus symbol means 50ms
 more, so if you see +++ your latency is between 100 and 149 ms.
-your 6 character attributes:
 STRength, INTelligence, WISdom, DEXterity, CONstitution, CHaRisma,
-your current sanity (sound means you are completely sane, this might drop, for
 example if a mindcrafter blasts your mind with psionic energy, leaving you
 mad)
-then comes your Armor Class (AC) which describes how well you are protected
 by all the armor you're currently wearing.
-The next two values are most important and will change all the time while
 fighting monsters.
 They are your Hit Points (HP) and Mana Points (MP), current/maximum values.
 Mana points are very important for wizards, since they determine which spells
 and how many of them you can cast. The current hit points (Cur HP) tell you if
 you are injured. If they drop below zero you die!
 If they are the same as your Max HP then you are fully rested and physically
 healed.
-Next entry is your stamina (ST), if you chose a class that makes use of it.
 Stamina may allow you to employ special techniques accessed with 'm'.
-Below stamina is a 'flag bar' which displays certain combat-related modi of
 your character, if available to your class:
 -Combat stance (Bl = balanced, Df = defensive, Of = offensive, see (6.2))
 -Dual-wield mode (DH = dual-hand aka default, MH = main hand only, see (6.2))
 -Fire-till-kill toggle (FK = enabled, see (5.2a))

Below that, there are further status indicators such as
-your current world map location (sector 32,32 aka the starter town of 'Bree'
 when you log in for the first time) and the 'AFK' status indicator
-as well as your food indicator ('full' by default). Note that if you don't
 eat when you become hungry you might get paralyzed sporadically and eventually
 even die of starvation!

In the lower middle to lower right area of the bottom status line of the main
window, you find:
-your speed (Normal, Slow or Fast)
-your number of melee attacks per round (BpR aka blows per round)
-your current depth or town. If you are in a town the town's name is displayed,
 otherwise the dungeon depth (negative numbers) or tower height (positive
 numbers) are shown, either in feet (each level equals 50 ft) or in levels,
 depending on your configuration. So if you stand on the world surface (0 ft)
 and enter a dungeon, you'd end up at -50 ft.
 This number can also have different colour, indicating some things:
 -A white number means no special effect.
 -An orange number means that Word of Recall magic is pending.
 -A yellow number means that your character's level is somewhat too high
  compared to the dungeon/tower level you are on, and therefore you will get
  greatly reduced amounts of experience points.
 -A grey number means that your character's level is way too high compared to
  the dungeon/tower level you are on, and therefore you will not get any
  experience points at all here.
 -When you spend about 2 minutes on a dungeon floor, a light blue asterisk '*'
  will appear behind the depth indicator, or if you are in a town the town's
  name will change colour to light blue.
  This means that on the next dungeon floor you enter you will receive an extra
  feeling, displayed in yellow colour, that tells you some rough information
  about the dangers lurking there. For more information see (4.8).

Note: There are certain areas in the game that inhibit teleportation, mostly
so-called "no-teleport vaults". These areas are extremely dangerous because if
a monster summons other monsters around you, you might not be able to escape!
If you enter such a no-tele area, it will be indicated as described in (4.8)
under "vault feelings".

By the way: If you enter the game and find that you don't like your
character and want to recreate it from scratch, you can suicide by pressing
'Q' (capital Q), followed by confirming the question if you really want to
suicide with 'y' and then finally verify your suicide with '@' key.
Note that a suicided character is completely and permanently gone (as is a
no-ghost/hellish character on mundane death).
Also see (0.2) for some details about suiciding.


(3.2a) The encumberment bar
---------------------------
Between AU and the mini lag-o-meter is a line indicating if you are encumbered
in any way. This line is blank by default, but may start to show little
coloured icons if your character becomes overburdened in some way.

If you are new to the game, you can skip the rest of this chapter for now,
as long as your encumberment bar doesn't show any icons in it, and continue
reading at (3.3) down below.

This line consists of the following icons that may show up:
(Order: From left to right)
    Brown (        Your armour is too heavy (tohit/sneakiness penalty).
    Red /          Your weapon is way too heavy for you.
                   You will receive extreme penalties on melee combat.
    Orange \       Your weapon isn't fit for your character (e.g. priest
                   using non-edged non-blessed weapons like swords).
                   You'll receive a big penalty on hit chance and damage.
                   An orange warning message will display:
                   "You do not feel comfortable with your weapon."
    Yellow /       You are using a 1,5-h weapon together with a shield.
                   This is possible, but you will receive a penalty on
                   hit chance and damage.
    Green |        You are using a 1h weapon two-handed and get a small
                   bonus from that (works only for some of the weapons).
    Red [          Your shield is way too heavy for you.
                   You will receive extreme penalties on block chance.
    Red }          Your ranged weapon is way too heavy for you.
                   You will receive extreme penalties on ranged combat.
    Yellow }       You are using a shield on your arm, reducing your
                   accuracy with your ranged weapon.
    Light-red 'F'  You are Martial Arts user and your backpack is too
                   heavy, so that you don't receive Free Action from MA!
                   See (5.3a) for more detailed information.
    Yellow (       You are Martial Arts user and your armour is too heavy.
                   You might receive various penalties (see (5.3a)).
                   NOTE: Up to client version 4.4.2 this can stand for both,
                   the meaning described above and the meaning of 'Blue ('
                   described below. Starting with 4.4.2a, these two were
                   separated into yellow and blue '(' icon.
    Blue (         You're a rogue or using primarily rogueish skills such
                   as dodging or Dual-wield which depend on especially
                   flexible armour (meaning: Your total armour weight must not
                   be too high), but your armour is exceeding that limit!
                   You will lose some of the benefits, see (5.5)!
    Violet (       Your armour is so heavy that it reduces your MP.
                   This only affects classes that have a mana pool.
    Violet ]    a) Your gloves are not made for spellcasting or too heavy,
                   reducing your MP.
                b) Your headgear is too heavy, impacting your ability to cast
                   mindcrafter school spells, reducing your MP. Only affects
                   characters who have trained in one or more of the
                   mindcrafter schools.
Also see (5.3a) and especially (5.5) for more information about encumberment,
and for specific details about penalties that are applied.



(3.3) Behaviour, chat messages and chat modes
---------------------------------------------
You can chat with other players by pressing the colon key ':' once you have
joined a game with your character.
In general, don't hesitate to ask questions. Players are usually willing to
help you with the beginnings. Keep in mind that players often don't have time
to look at the chat while they are fighting monsters, that means if you write
to someone while he is in the dungeon, he often likely won't notice your
message. Politely try again after some time.
You can scroll back the messages using CTRL+P, or look at chat-only messages
using CTRL+O.

Please do not use foul language in chat. If you do, depending on the server
settings you might end up in jail.
Also, foul language is filtered by default. If you want to turn that off,
press  = 2  and toggle the client option "censor_swearing". (Requires client
version newer than 4.4.8a.)

You can also enter slash commands in the chat line. For details about slash
commands see (0.2b).

To type a private message to someone, enter <name>:<text>
Example:    Hi!             <- goes to everyone
            C. Blue:Hi!     <- goes privately to the character named 'C. Blue'
In chat messages you can type a double colon '::' to force output of a normal
colon ':' instead of having it interpreted as separator for a private chat
message. Most smileys are recognized automatically and don't require you to
enter a double colon.

You can use colours in messages. To change the message colour, put a {
followed by a colour code somewhere into your message line.
Example:
        {pHi!               <- results in a 'poison-coloured' Hi!
        I see some {vh {Bto the east
                            <- results in "I see some h in the east"
                               where the 'h' is violet. The rest of the
                               message is light blue (standard colour).
If you cannot see coloured messages in your secondary Tomenet windows other
than the big main window, check your client option settings by typing  =1
and looking for 'Flicker messages in recall' (recall_flicker). Set it to
'yes'.
If you want to type the character '{' in a chat message, rather than using
it for a colour code, type it twice '{{'. It will become '{'.

Here is a list of colour codes (try not to annoy your fellow players :))
    d  black            b  blue             B  light blue
    D  dark grey        g  green            G  light green
    s  slate (grey)     r  red              R  light red (pink)
    W  white            u  umber            U  light umber
    w  bright white     y  yellow           o  orange           v  violet

    a  acidic           c  cold             e  electric         f  fire
    p  poison           L  light flicker    h  half-multi       m  multi
    A  dark flicker     S  sound            C  confusion        H  shards
    I  invulnerability  M  disruption shield

There are extended colour codes available since 4.5.2 (some in later clients)
    P  psi              x  nexus            n  nether           q  inertia
    T  disenchantment   F  force            V  gravity          t  time
    E  meteor           N  mana             Q  disintegration   Y  water
    i  ice              l  plasma           O  detonation       k  nuke
    K  unbreath         j  holy orb         J  holy fire        X  hell fire
    z  thunder          Z  ember            0  starlight        1  havoc


Character names in chat lines have different colours to indicate their status:

White           Normal player.
Light blue      Everlasting player.
Dark grey       No-ghost / hellish player.
Violet          Player character is king / queen.
Dark blue       Player is admin.
Red             Player is a ghost (ie dead).
Yellow          Player is a PvP-mode character.


Chat modes:
-----------
After pressing ':' key to enter chat mode, you may press TAB key to switch
between the three chat modes:
-normal
-party chat: All messages are sent exclusively to your own party.
-level chat: All messages are sent to everyone on your dungeon level.
-guild chat: All messages are sent to all your fellow guild members (if any).

Note: While TAB cycles forward, you can also press CTRL+U to cycle backwards,
CTRL+A to switch to 'normal' mode, CTRL+T to switch to 'party' (team) mode,
CTRL+G for 'guild' mode and CTRL+L for 'level' (floor) mode.


Also you can use the following prefixes in the beginning of a chat line,
to get similar behaviour as in one of the chat modes just for one line:
!:      Sends the following text to your current party.
$:      Sends the following text to your current guild.
#:      Sends the following text to everyone on your dungeon level.
        Note: While in town this will instead become a /say.
%:      Sends the following text to yourself (has some use in macros).
+:      Sends the following text to the last person who whispered us a private
        message, so it's sort of a 'reply' function.


Note that you can use CTRL+p and CTRL+n while in chat mode (':' key),
to repeat a message or command you previously typed.



(3.4) Start-up equipment
------------------------
Every new player has some items right from the beginning, in the past those
came stored in the inventory but nowadays they are immediately equipped.
As a warrior you will have a chain mail and a weapon, for example a sword.
Start-up equipment always has level 0 and cannot be used by other players!

If you find further items you can equip them with 'w' key - you will be asked
which item you would like to wear or wield, choose the letter in front of the
item inside your inventory, for example e) if the item is the fifth item in
your backpack.

Make sure that you have a lightsource ready to be equipped, like a torch or a
lantern. If it is night in town that will help you to see anything. Inside a
dungeon most passages and rooms tend to be dark so you should always have a
lightsource equipped while in a dungeon.

Startup items that you don't want to use you may simply destroy with 'k'.
In town, you can see rectangular blocks that rensemble buildings. These are the
town stores. They each have an entrance, rensembled by a number '1' to '7' as
well as '9' and '+' symbols. These are the different shops that you can enter
to sell or buy items. It is recommended that instead of using your torches, buy
a brass lantern from store '1' (General Store), because a lantern provides more
light, increasing your radius of sight in the darkness. Also buy a flask of oil
for your lantern to refill it if it runs out of oil (press SHIFT + f).

Press '?' to see an in-game introduction and overview of the keys and commands
that you may use. For example 'e' will show your currently equipped items.
You can chat with other players using the ':' key. This way you can also enter
certain commands like /fill to fill an empty bottle with water of a fountain.
At the beginning, all players receive a parchment with their start-up
equipment. It's the "Gazette". Press 'r' to read it. It may contain some notes
about the server or hints for newbies.


(3.4a) Item basics
------------------
When you've logged in and look at your inventory (your backpack, basically),
ie the items your character starts with, you will see various item names that
give you some sort of idea what the item is good for, along with some cryptic
numbers and brackets.
The meaning of these will be explained here:

a Ration of Food {0,+}
    Pretty straightforward, this is an item that you can consume if you get
    hungry. To do so, use SHIFT+e to 'eat' this item.
    The {..} part means the following:

    The number in it is the level required to use this item. 0 means that you
    started out with this item, ie it was given to your character on birth.

    The '+' symbol means that you OWN the item. If it was someone else's ration
    then you would see his name written there instead of the '+', for example:
    a Ration of Food {0,Gandalf}.
    If the owner died and the item hasn't been picked up yet by someone else
    who meets the level requirements, it will display a '-' instead of a name,
    meaning it has been owned, but the owner died. Example:
    a Ration of Food {0,-}.

    If you own an item or found an item, then the level requirements won't
    matter. Even if they are much higher than your level, you can still use it.

    The level requirements are only important for TRADING an item:
    If the character who receives the item is too low to match the level
    requirement, he won't become the owner of the item and therefore will be
    unable to use the item until he reaches the level. He can still carry the
    item in his inventory though, but it will be displayed in dark grey to him,
    indicating that it isn't usable yet.

    Note that you usually can neither trade nor sell items that are level 0.
    Food is an exception to this rule, since it can be traded (but not sold).

    For those interested in more details, that item level is roughly determined
    based on the following factors:
     - Base item level (the dungeon depth where it starts popping up)
     - A slight increase for when it's found on even much deeper floors
     - An increase depending on ego powers it possesses.
    Some items have special level requirement calculations, for example the
    level of a ring of speed is directly tied to its +speed value.

a Chain Mail {0,+} (-2) [14,+0]
    The {..} part is already known, it's the same as for the ration described
    above. What's new is the [..] part, which all types of armour have:

    The (-2) part is a to-hit malus. This armour reduces your to-hit value by
    2, because of its bulkiness. Lighter armour has -1 or no to-hit malus,
    heavier armour may have even more than -2.

    Rectangular brackets [..] describe 'Armour Class' or short AC. AC is a
    number that tells you how well the item helps to protect you when a monster
    (or a player whom you duel) hits you.

    The first number stands for the item's 'base AC'. All 'Chain Mails' have
    the same base AC of 14. All 'Metal Caps' have a base AC of 3, and so on.

    The second number, here a +0, can vary: It is this item's magical
    enchantment. It is simply added to the base AC to determine the total AC
    this item provides.

    For example a Chain Mail [14,+3] is magically enchanted 3 times, and
    therefore will provide you with 17 AC instead of just 14, ie 14+3.
    Armour class helps for both: Reducing the chance to get hit, and reducing
    the actual damage you suffer in case you are hit.

    Likewise, if you fight an acidic monster for example, the acid might damage
    your Chain Mail, and turn it into for example a Chain Mail [14,-2].
    This Chain Mail only provides you with 12 AC. You can 'repair' it if you
    want to, by buying 'Scrolls of enchant armour' from store 5 in town.
    These will try to enchant a piece of armour, so if you are lucky you can
    just use two of them on your armour and end up with a Chain Mail [14,+0]
    again. Note that enchanting has a chance to fail, depending on how high
    an item has been enchanted already.

a Long Sword {0,+} (2d6) (+0,+0)
    Again the {..} part is already know. What's new for all types of weapons is
    the (2d6) and the (+0,+0) part:

    Like in Dungeons & Dragons, on which rules some aspects of the game are
    loosely based, when your character attacks a monster (or another player),
    dice are cast to determine the amount of damage your blow deals.

    The (2d6) mean that when you hit someone with this weapon, two dice of six
    sides each are cast, so you may deal anything from 2 to 12 damage randomly.
    (The real damage the target suffers can possibly be further reduced by the
    target's armour class or protective magic.)

    Similar to armour, weapons can be enchanted too. This is the second pair of
    brackets: (+0,+0).

    The first +0 means that this weapon has no magical enchantment to its hit
    chance, ie how likely it is to hit a target.

    The second +0 means that this weapon has no magical enchantment to the
    damage it deals. Example:
    a Long Sword (2d6) (+5,+6) would add 5 to your hit chance, which isn't very
    much, but still better than nothing. Probably worth more is the fact that
    it also adds 6 to your damage dealt!
    This means on each attack it will deal 2d6 +6 damage, which would be
    anything from 2+6 to 12+6, ie 8..18. As you can see, this is a considerable
    improvement over 2..12 of an unenchanted Long Sword.

    Note that training weapon-related skills will also add to your overall
    +damage bonus. So your character might have +34 to-damage using a mere
    Long Sword (2d6) (+9,+15), with the remaining +19 damage coming from your
    'Sword-mastery' skill that you trained.

    Also note that often it can be better to wield lighter weapons instead of
    heavier weapons, if you can attack more often during each round with them.
    Example: A light dagger might allow you to attack 3 times, while a heavy
    two-handed sword will only allow you one swing each turn. Here you will
    have to do some math with the weapon dice, your total +damage from weapon
    and skill, and the number of blows/round you get with each weapon, to find
    out which setup is best for your character at a given time.

a Long Bow {0,+} (x3) (+0,+0)
    Ranged weapons all have a 'multiplier' given in the first pair of round
    brackets, and the (+hit,+dam) enchantments already known from normal melee
    weapons.

    The multiplier, here x3, means two things:
    a) how far you can shoot
    b) by how much the damage dealt by your arrow (or shot or bolt, depending
       on the weapon type) will be multiplied.
    This means that enchanting a ranged weapon's damage is especially effective
    because the +damage bonus will also be multiplied by the weapons's factor!
    Example: a Long Bow (x3) (+2,+4) will actually add not +4 but 3x+4 = +12
    damage to each shot! This is why archers should try to visit store 5 as
    soon as possible to buy some 'Scrolls of enchant weapon to-dam' from it,
    to enchant their bows or other ranged weapons.

a Wooden Torch {0,+} (with 2500 turns of light)
    Not much new here, except that this item has a 'timeout' given in turns.
    After having this item equipped for 2500 turns (about half of that in
    seconds, very roughly), the torch will be depleted and not produce any
    more light, so you can drop/destroy/sell it, or press SHIFT+f to add
    a fresh torch from your inventory to your almost depleted one, thereby
    refueling it (this makes sense if you are using a torch that provides
    special magic powers).

If you buy a shovel or pick from store '1' to dig up treasure veins, it looks
like this:
a Pick {+,1} (0,+2) (+1)
    The to-hit and to-dam bonus do not count for fighting, but instead slightly
    help digging. The main factor though is the (+1). For digging tools, this
    bonus describes their main digging power. The to-hit and to-dam effect is
    rather small compared to this main factor. Also, the weight of your digging
    tool also has a little effect (the heavier the better).
Later on in the game you might find 'ego' digging tools, for example:
a Pick of Digging {+,9} (+5,+9) (+1) (+3)
    It's basically same as the normal pick, except it has a second (+3) mod at
    the end. This belongs to the 'of Digging' suffix and, same as the (+1),
    further increases the digging ability, in the same way the (+1) does.
    So overall you can just view it as if it was a Pick (+4) (1 plus 3).
(See (5.20) for details about digging.)


(3.4b) Items that are always tradable
-------------------------------------
Certain items can always be traded, no matter the item level or owner mode (ie
everlasting vs non-everlasting vs pvp). They will in turn receive a 100% value
discount on trading. Those items are:

-Any kind of food
-Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger
-Scrolls of Word of Recall
-Amulets of the Highlands
-Game pieces (eg chess, heavy ball)



(3.5) Preparing the first time for fighting enemies
---------------------------------------------------
Before you enter a dungeon by stepping onto a staircase leading into the earth
(looks like this: '>') and pressing the staircase symbol '>' you will have to
buy some more items for the following reasons:
At the very beginning a single enemy who is a little bit stronger could kill
you easily without you having a chance to escape. At the same time,
slaying strong opponents at the very beginning will give very much experience,
thus making your character rise in experience levels and in power very
quickly!
Going deep down into the dungeon with a very low character level in hope of
meeting a monster that gives lots of experience while at the same time is not
too hard to kill is called "diving" and often is kind of suicide while
sometimes very rewarding.
However, buying certain items will greatly raise your chance of escaping from
dangerous situations alive or even slaying tough opponents. Also, by buying
an item (like magic potions or scrolls) your character will remember what it
'looks like' and instantly recognize it if you find some of the same type in
the dungeon. If you find a potion/scroll unknown to your character you will
have to either use it or sell it to a shop or use a scroll of identify to find
out what it is.
So to prepare for hunting in the dungeon, buy:
-Potion of Heroism (maybe just one, for when you encounter a unique monster)
-Potion of Cure Light/Serious Wounds
-Scroll of Phase Door
 The more you can buy of those the better. At least buy one potion of Heroism
 and Cure Serious Wounds.
And if you still have spare money (this one costs a lot) a
-Scroll of Word of Recall. (See "(0.3) Important inscriptions, Word of Recall"
 for more info.)



(3.6) Creating basic macros & inscribing items
----------------------------------------------
Macros are absolutely obligatory, you _will_ need them, so read this
carefully and if something isn't explained well, ask your fellow players to
clarify.

In turn-based single-player rogue-like games you always have enough time to
press "q" (quaff a potion) followed by the according inventory slot, for
example b) (if there is a potion of cure critical wounds in the second
inventory slot).

However, TomeNET is multiplayer and real-time. This means you don't have
enough time to look at your inventory and search the correct letters for items
which you might need *this instance* to avoid certain death. Often situations
get hectic, for example if all of a sudden dark-elven warlocks come around
the corner while you are engaging a pack of wolves, then you need kind of a
panic button that quickly transports you out of trouble.

To comply with this need, a macro system has been implemented, allowing you to
program freely choosable keys of your keyboard to perform a series of other
keypresses or commands when pressed. These macros can also interact with
certain items of your inventory by using "item inscriptions". You can inscribe
items (usually with the '{' key) as often as you like to, the inscription is
for example useful if an item has special abilities that you want to remember
by looking at it. To remove an inscription, use the } key.
You would for example inscribe an Elven Cord Armor that you know helps you to
resist the effects of poison. Then it might look like this in your inventory:
Before: d) an Elven Cord Armor [6,+20] (+1) {+,10}
After:  d) an Elven Cord Armor [6,+20] (+1) {+,10} {resists poison!}
Inscriptions don't just help you to remember the abilities of certain items,
they can also interact with the macro system and other aspects of the game.

Usually if you want to quaff your potion of Heroism or read a scroll of Phase
Door, you would press keys 'q' 'c', q for quaff, then c for third inventory
slot for example, or 'r' 'd' (r for read, then d for the fourth inventory
slot, if your scroll resides here).
However, if you just picked up another potion, your inventory order might be
changed and you had to remember the new positions of your vital potion and
scroll.

Now we are going to create three macros that will instantly quaff the potions
or read a scroll of recall, no matter where in the inventory they exactly are,
on a single keypress! Inscribe the potion of Heroism "@q1", the scroll of
Phase Door "@r1" and the potion of Cure Light Wounds "@q2".
It should look like this now:
b) a potion of Heroism {+,1} {@q1}
c) a potion of Cure Light Wounds {+,1} {@q2}
d) a scroll of Phase Door {+,1} {@r1}

Now we will create macros that make use of these items. Invoke the macro menu
by pressing '%' key. Then choose "(a) Enter a new action" and enter the
following two characters and press Enter:
q1
Now choose "(h) Create a hybrid macro", then press the F1 key.
Now enter a new action, this time q2 instead of q1. Create another macro, this
time hit F2. Then Enter the third macro, r1, and choose F3 key.
Have your TomeNET client save the macros to a file on your hard disk, in your
TomeNET directory at \lib\user by choosing "(s) Save macros" and entering a
filename, or simply confirming the shown default file name which is the same
as your character (recommended!).

Now if you press F1 you will automatically quaff the potion of Heroism, F2 for
Cure Light Wounds and F3 to read the scroll. You are ready to enter the
dungeon now. If you still have some spare money, buy a flask of oil to fuel
your lantern if it runs out, as well as some rations of food in case you get
hungry.
The next time you log on, you may load your previously saved macro file by
invoking the macro menu again ('%'), choosing "(l) Load macros" and
entering the filename. If you saved the macros to the same name as your
character, they will be automatically loaded, saving you that hassle.

An even simpler way to create macros is the 'macro wizard' described in (3.7c).


The macro recorder:
-------------------
Note that instead of entering an action string (such as 'q1' or 'r5'), the
macro menu also provides a 'macro recorder', which when invoked will record
all your key presses until you enter the macro menu again. Then the keys
you pressed will be the default action that you can directly bind to a trigger
key by choosing normal, command, or hybrid macro.


Note that while it is probably overkill to create macro hotkeys for items
which aren't as important as healing or teleportation, inscribing them can
still be helpful because it allows you to easily access them.

Example: You inscribed your flasks of oil @F1 . Now if your lantern is running
low on oil you just type the keys 'F' (to fill) and '1' instead of having to
search your inventory for the correct slot letter the oil flasks reside at.
Same goes for other items that aren't used in time-critical situations during
combat but nevertheless regularly, like scrolls of identify.

If two items have the same inscription, for example Potions of Cure Critical
Wounds @q1 and Potions of Healing @q1, the item which is above the others in
your inventory is chosen. So in this example you'd first use up all CCW
potions, then use the healing potions because CCW are located above healing
potions in your inventory. You can uninscribe items with the '}' key.


Loading macros automatically:
-----------------------------
If you save your macros to a filename that is the same as your character's
name and add a '.prf' at the end, it will be automatically loaded as you
join a game with your character, which is very helpful!
Example: If your character is named 'Kinkan', save the macros to Kinkan.prf
to have them loaded automatically.
Note: If you're using a Linux version, remember that the file system is
case-sensitive, so don't save your macros to 'kinkan.prf' since your character
actually starts with a capital 'K' or the file won't be loaded. Make sure
the filename and character-, class- or race-name are exactly the same
('Dwarf.prf', 'High-Elf.prf', 'Ranger.prf'..).
Another option is to save the macros to a file named 'global.prf' (all lower
case letters). This is a special macro file that will always be loaded, for
all characters of yours.
You can also save macros to <racename>.prf or to <classname>.prf, like
Warrior.prf to have them being auto-loaded on all characters of that class.
Priority order (latter one overrides prior one):

These files are meant to store client options and configuration,
you should NOT use them for macros:
-----------------------------------
pref.prf (global for all OS and users on the system)
*.opt files (client options configuration files, ending on ".opt")
pref-<operating system>.prf (loaded if under the specific operating system)
graf-<operating system>.prf OR font-<operating system>.prf
                            (loaded if using graphics / ascii font on the
                             specified system)
user-<operating system>.prf (loaded if under the specific operating system)

These files can be used for saving your macros to without problems:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
'global.prf' (is always loaded for any character the player logs in with.
               be sure to use all lower-case letters, not 'Global.prf'!)
<race>.prf (for the specific race)
<class>.prf (for the specific class)
<character name>.prf (for the specific character the player logged in with)

It is recommended to use only race/class/character preference files
for storing your macros.


Command macros:
---------------
Command macros are only executed if the game isn't currently waiting for a
specific input, for example "quaff which potion?" or while you're typing chat
messages. That means they won't "disrupt" any other command which is currently
being run. This is convenient for keys which you use in chat, but can be
dangerous if you define vital macros as command macros.
It is recommended to make your most important macros normal macros or at least
hybrid macros (for example a "panic key" macro). Command macros don't work
in shops.


Hybrid macros:
--------------
Use 'create hybrid macro' instead of 'create normal macro' in case you don't
want the macro to appear on hitting the corresponding key in a normal chat
message (for example useful for '-' key so it won't prevent you from
inscribing your Word of Recall scrolls).
Hybrid macros still work within input requests such as "quaff which potion?",
just not in STRING INPUT such as chat lines, polymorph-codes or money amounts.
Hybrid macros don't work in shops.


Delete macros:
----------------
If you accidentally bound a macro to a key which wasn't free, for example
the key 'r' which is used to read a scroll, you can reset the key by
-pressing % to invoke the macro menu
-choosing '(d) - delete macro'
-pressing the key wich you want to reset.



(3.7) Creating macros for ranged attacks & abilities (spells)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This section is becoming pretty advanced. If you want to try an easier
method but miss a nice fundamental explanation on the way macros work, you
may just jump to (3.7c) now, where the comfortable macro wizard is explained!

Those macros basically consist of three parts.
1. Clearing the keyboard buffer (to avoid your character locking up in
   an attack queue if you hammer the trigger button for a ranged attack).
2. Designating a target.
3. Attacking the designated target.
What does the macro look like? (Note: Keys could vary depending on your
key set definitions. Throwing might be 't' instead of 'v' etc.)
For..
a) casting a magical spell
    Press 'm' to see your choices of casting magical spells. Let's assume you
    see this menu then:
        a) check dodge chance
        b) cast a spell
    Now we want 'b'. Press it to see a list of your magical books in your
    inventory. Let's assume you have learned spell 'a)' from book 'b)' in
    your inventory. Since the order of your books could change if you pick up
    new items or drop old ones, we will inscribe your magical book that is
    currently at position 'b)' like this (press '{' key to inscribe):
    @m2
    The '2' is our own choice. We could've used 7 or 0 if we wanted to. Note
    that it must be a single digit! @m20 does not work.
    Now we can create the macro.
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press 'a' to enter a new action,
    -enter:    \e)*tmb2a-
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target for the
                            spell (if there is an enemy)!
                    m       invoke the ability menu
                    b       choose 'b) cast a spell'
                    2       use the magical book which is inscribed @m2
                    a       use spell 'a)' from this book
                    -       use previously designated target as direction, if
                            that target is actually valid. Otherwise cancel the
                            spell!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit 'h - create a hybrid macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F1' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -To save your macros, press 's - Save macros' and enter a filename of
     your choice. If you want your macros to be loaded automatically when you
     log in with your character, save them to '<yourname>.prf'. For example
     to 'Gandalf.prf' if your character is called 'Gandalf'.
     If your macros are not automatically loaded, you'll have to do it
     manually after logging in, by pressing % and choosing 'l - Load macros',
     then specifying the according filename.
    Note that if your character gains additional abilities that show up
    in the 'm' menu, it might happen that 'b) cast a spell' becomes
    'c) cast a spell' which would require you to redefine your macros.
    Fortunately there is a way around this, by using Ability Codes instead of
    letters to pick a skill to use. See 'Ability codes' below.
    Further, in (3.9b) a way of casting spells (or using items in general)
    without relying on inscriptions at all will be explained!
b) throwing an item at a monster (or player)
    Throwing would be done by pressing 'v', followed by the item and either
    one of the 8 directions or '*t' to designate the closest enemy as the
    target.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press 'a' to enter a new action,
    -lets assume the item you want to throw is at position 'c)'.
     It's 'c) 3 potions of blindness'.
     You could now either specify the slot 'c)' in the macro or you could
     inscribe the potions @v1 and replace the c in the macro string by a 1.
     Inscribing has the advantage that if the potions change their location
     in your inventory you could still throw them. If you use 'c' you'd just
     throw the item at position 'c)' even if the potions are currently 'd)'.
     Examples:
     enter:    \e)vc*t      or      \e)v1*t
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    v       throw an item
                    c   OR  1
                            choose 'c) 3 potions of blindness' OR
                            choose the item for throwing which is currently
                            inscribed @v1
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit 'h - Create a hybrid macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing 's - Save macros' if you
     plan to use it again.
c) firing your equipped ranged weapon (sling, bow, crossbow)
    The keys we need are 'f' to fire and a direction key or *t to simply
    target the closest enemy.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press 'a' to enter a new action,
    -Since ammunition for firing or a boomerang is always at a fixed position
     in your equipment, we do not need any inscriptions on the weapon or
     ammunition - the game knows which item we want to use since there's only
     one possible choice.
     enter:    \e)*tf-
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
                    f       fire an item (boomerang, if equipped) or
                            fire ammunition (if launcher & ammo is equipped)
                    -       use previously designated target as direction, if
                            it's still valid, otherwise cancel firing!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit 'h - Create a hybrid macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing 's - Save macros' if you
     plan to use it again.
d) zapping a magical rod or aiming with a magical wand
    Rods are used by 'z' (zap a rod) and wands by 'a' (aim a wand),
    followed by the item and either one of the 8 directions or '*t' to
    designate the closest enemy as target.
    The macro:
    -Press '%' to invoke the macro menu,
    -press 'a' to enter a new action,
    -lets assume you want to aim the wand at position 'c)'.
     It's 'c) a wand of magic missiles'.
     You could now either specify the slot 'c)' in the macro or you could
     inscribe the wand @a0 and replace the c in the macro string by a 0.
     Inscribing has the advantage that if the potions change their location
     in your inventory you could still throw them. If you use 'c' you'd just
     throw the item at position 'c)' even if the wand currently is at 'd)'.
     Examples:
     enter:    \e)*tac-      or      \e)*ta0-
     This means:    \e)     clear the keyboard buffer
                    *t      designate the closest enemy as the target!
                    a       aim a wand (or 'z' to use a rod here)
                    c   OR  0
                            choose 'c) a wand of magic missiles' OR
                            choose the item which is currently
                            inscribed @a0   (or @z0 for a rod)
                    -       use previously designated target as direction, if
                            it's still valid, otherwise cancel firing!
    -press ENTER key to accept that macro,
    -now hit 'h - Create a hybrid macro'
    -hit the key you want to bind this macro to, for example the 'F2' key.
     F-keys are a good choice for macros, since they're not used otherwise.
    -Don't forget to save your macro by pressing 's - Save macros' if you
     plan to use it again.

What happens if you leave out the '\e)' part?
Well, that means the commands that aren't processed yet will stay in the
buffer and wait for execution. Example:
You hit the macro  *tf-  30 times rapidly. Now your character will shoot 30
times with his bow. However, since he's quite slow, this might take him 30
seconds! You now sit in front of your keyboard and watch your character
process all the remaining 30 shots. If suddenly an enemy appears that needs
you to teleport away because it's too dangerous, you couldn't press any key
until the 30 shots are finished. The character is 'locked'.
The ')' in the macro '\e)*tf-' clears all previous keypresses and hence
allows you to hammer the macro without fearing a lock.


(3.7a) Ability codes
--------------------
A problem with the 'm' key is that it not only brings up your magic spells
but a menu containing all skills you can use. Those can be arrow fletching
or dodging for example.
Now you would have to rewrite your macros each time you gain another ability,
since entries in 'm' menu might shift if a new skill gets inserted somewhere.
To avoid this, you can directly choose which skill (ie spell-casting) you
want to use in your macros, by specifying the "ability code"!

Here is a list of all available ability codes:
3       Use innate power (for mimicry-users)
4       Toggle Fire-till-kill mode, usable by anyone. See (5.2a).
5       Fighting techniques (see (6.12))
6       Shooting techniques (see (6.12))
8       Check your dodge chance (for dodging skill)
(included in '6' now: 9       Craft ammunition (for archery skill))
10      Set a monster trap (for trapping skill, see (4.7))
11      Cast a magic spell / recite a holy prayer
12      Draw a rune (for runecraft, see '(6.8b) Runes & Runemastery')
13      Change combat stance (for combat stances skill)
14      Check your chances of parrying and blocking (for melee fighters,
        see (6.11) for details about these abilities)
15      Toggle 'Aura of Fear' if you have trained the according skill.
16      Toggle 'Shivering Aura' if you have trained the according skill.
17      Toggle 'Aura of Death' if you have trained the according skill.

After the ability code has been entered you need to press Enter to confirm it.
In a macro, this is done by '\r' (one of the so-called escape sequences).
Example for a macro that directly specifies the ability code to cast the magic
spell "a) Manathrust" from book "a) Beginner Cantrips" on the closest monster:

\e)*tm@11\r2a-

What does that mean?
\e  ->  escape any pending input request, if there is any
        (so we don't have to press ESC before casting the spell in case we're
         currently 'L'ooking around or something)
)   ->  clear the keyboard buffer (removes all pending keypresses that haven't
        been processed yet due to slow character speed, so we become instantly
        ready to perform our Manathrust spell _now_)
*t  ->  choose the closest monster as target
m   ->  invoke an ability
@   ->  specify an ability code directly
11  ->  the code for 'cast a magic spell/recite a holy prayer'
\r  ->  press Enter to confirm
2   ->  cast from book 2 (inscription on the book must be @m2)
a   ->  cast spell "a)" (Manathrust)
-   ->  use previously designated target as direction, if it's still valid,
        otherwise cancel the spell!

(That macro basically does the same as:
*tmb2a-
..assumed that entry 'b)' in the ability menu (invoked by 'm') is
'b) Cast a spell'. Except for escaping and clearing the keyboard buffer.)

An even better way to cast spells is to not rely on book inscriptions, but to
cast spells by name instead. That way you won't have to redo spells when your
books change. See (3.9b) for details, or (3.7c) for the 'macro wizard', which
uses cast-by-name by default for all macros you create in it (yet can also
handle call-by-inscription).


(3.7b) Quick'n'dirty macros
---------------------------
Macro actions can be complex and hence time-consuming to enter and prone to
errors furthermore.
To allow you to quickly hack in macro actions, there's the Quick'n'Dirty
option in the macro menu, which will accept short cut characters instead of
the usual full macro.

On entering the macro action, those characters will be automatically expanded
to their real functionality. They are:
  P for using a mimic's innate power
    Example:  Pd
    Uses innate power 'd)', which is the first real innate spell after the
    three polymorph powers themselves, which always comprise a) to c).
  I for using a mimic's 'transform-into-specific' power.
    Example:  I191
    This will become  \e)@m3\rc191\r  (transform into a Grizzly Bear).
    Clients of versions greater than 4.4.8c also support entering a monster
    name instead of its code, example:  I@Fruit bat\
  F for employing a fighting technique
    Example:  Fa
    (Use fighting technique 'a)', which usually is 'sprint'.)
  S for employing a shooting technique
    Example:  Sa
    (Use shooting technique 'a)', which is probably 'flare'.)
  M for casting a spell
    Example:  M@Phase Door\
    Becomes  \e)m@11\r@Phase Door\r  (cast spell 'Phase Door'.)
  R for drawing a rune
    Examples:  Rcbaa  or Rc\raa  to draw 2 or just 1 rune.
    (The last two 'a' being spell modifier and spell form respectively.)
  T for setting up a trap
    Example:  T13
    Set up the monster trap inscribed '@m1' or '@1' loaded with item inscribed
    '@m3' or '@3'. (Becomes '\e)m@10\r13'.)
  s for changing a stance
    Example:  sa  (switches to stance 'a)' ie balanced combat stance.)
  @...\ for using call-by-name (spell/item name must be between '@' and '\')
    (Examples have been given above, in some spell casting explanations.)

All other keys are taken over unmodified, like 'f' for firing a ranged weapon.

Also, '\e)' is automatically prefixed, and the most fitting macro type
automatically chosen (depending on the trigger key).

Additional examples:
Example 1: Firing your ranged weapon would just be..
        *tf-
    (which gets expanded to '\e)*tf-'.)

Example 2: Assumed your book is inscribed @m1 as usual, and you want to cast
    spell a). What you can simply enter in the q'n'd field is:
        *tM1a-
    and it will automatically be expanded to the real macro '\e)*tm@11\r1a-'.

Example 3: Assumed you have the spell Manathrust somewhere in your books and
    want to cast it by name, what you enter in the q'n'd field is:
        *tM@Manathrust\-
    and it will automatically be expanded to '\e)*tm@11\r@Manathrust\r-'.

Example 4: Casting Phase Door would be..
        M@Phase Door\
    (expanded to '\e)m@11\r@Phase Door\r'.)


(3.7c) The macro wizard
-----------------------
The easiest (and therefore most limited) way to create a macro is to invoke the
built-in macro creation wizard. If you are new to the game and too impatient to
figure out how to create macros manually, you might want to give this a try.

To invoke it, enter the macro menu by pressing '%', then press 'z' to bring up
the wizard.

The wizard will lead you through three steps with detailed on-screen
instructions, allowing you to create macros from a couple of pre-defined
command choices which should cover almost all situations.

If the option 'Rogue-like commands' is set to 'yes' when creating a macro in
the macro wizard, rogue-like command keys will be used in the macro action.

(The macro type, ie command/hybrid/normal will be chosen automatically for you,
same as when using Quick'n'Dirty macro creation.)

NOTE: Whenever the macro wizard asks you to enter a partial name of an item to
      use in the macro you may alternatively enter an item inscription instead
      if you prefer that!
      This works simply because item inscriptions are part of the 'item name'
      which the macro wizard parses.
      Example:
      If you create a macro to quaff a potion and the wizard asks you to enter
      the potion name or part of it you may instead just enter
          @q1
      and the resulting macro will attempt to quaff potions inscribed @q1.


(3.7d) Specifying directions and targets
----------------------------------------
Whenever you use an attack spell or a wand or rod that cast bolts or balls,
the game prompts you to enter a direction.
Similarly, friendly spells such as 'cure wounds' require you to target another
player (or yourself).
So there are different targetting methods you can choose from:

In our macros so far we have answered the 'which direction' question by
specifying '*t' instead of an actual direction ie one of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9.
We have learned that '*' means 'acquire target' and 't' means 'choose closest
hostile target'. If there are two targets that are equally close, one that is
awake is preferred over one that is alseep.
The '*' key can also be pressed as a command key, ie on its own without any
direction request from the server. Press '*' and it will ask you to set a
target, which you can do by pressing 't' again to choose the closest hostile
entity.

There are, however, more ways to specify a direction or to use the target
command, especially since client 4.4.6 which added the '-' option, and 4.4.6b
which added the '+' option.
Details follow:

The 'Set Target' command (key '*') that sets a target for spells or item uses
that follow, or which can be invoked as a sub-command from a 'Direction?'
request, may be answered with..
-------------------------------
  -'q' key to drop current target without acquiring a new one.
  -'t' or '5' key to choose closest hostile target.
  -'p' to target a grid position manually via movement keys (1..9),
       confirm with 't' or '5' key.

The 'Direction?' request from commands that require a direction, may be
answered with..
---------------
  -a direction key such as 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9.
   Note that direction '5' will only aim at yourself if you have no valid
   target set. Otherwise, the '5' key will aim at your target instead.
  -'*' key to invoke built-in target command (see above).
  -'-' key to use a previously acquired target or cancel the spell/item use/
       shot if there is no valid target currently set. The '-' option is only
       available in client version 4.4.6 and higher.
  -'+' key, same as '-' except that it won't cancel the action if no valid
       target was found, but prompt you for manual input instead (hit ESC to
       cancel, 5 to target your own grid, or any direction key to fire into
       that direction).

       Note that the key '-' is not a command key, but just gets ignored when
       pressed elsewhere than in direction-requests. This means that you can
       create 'hacky' macros, for example such as *t/1- that will work with
       both, magic devices that take a direction and those that don't, since
       the '-' will just be ignored for those that don't.

Friendly targetting:
--------------------
Sometimes you want to target a friendly player. For this you can use '('.
That key currently targets the most hurt player who is in your party, or the
most wounded player in general if you aren't in a party.
After this target has been set, you can refer to it with '-', '+' or '5' same
as for hostile targets you set with '*' explained above.

Example macros:
---------------
  *tz0-     Will zap rod 0 at the closest hostile entity. If there is none,
            the rod will not be zapped, conserving the rod's energy.
  z0*t      Zaps rod 0 at the closest hostile entity. If there is none, the
            rod will be zapped anyway, with yourself as target. This could
            be useful if it's for example a Rod of Fire Balls and you are
            being attacked in close combat by an invisible monster.
  *qz05     Your current target is cleared and the rod 0 is zapped at your
            own location, ie '5'. This could be useful if you want to clear
            out piles of loot with a rod of acid balls, effectively destroying
            all lesser items that cannot resist acid and melt from it.
  (m@11\r@Cure Wounds\r-
            Will cast the spell 'Cure Wounds' (from the Holy Curing school)
            at the most wounded friendly player. Will not do anything if no
            player is nearby. Replace the '-' by a '5' to target yourself
            if no other player is around.



(3.8) Example macro sets
------------------------
(For the meaning of '\e)' see below (3.9). I recommend to have all your
macros start with the '\e)' sequence to avoid character lock-ups due to
queued keypresses that have to be processed.)


An example macro set for fighters or archers:
---------------------------------------------
This macro set is already in your /lib/user folder! If it's not there,
download the latest client from www.tomenet.eu or our personal pages.
You can load this macro file by hitting % to invoke the macro menu,
then enter 'l' to load a macro file, and specifying its filename,
which is depending on your operating system:

linux_fighter.prf    or    windows_fighter.prf
(On Mac OS X use linux_fighter.prf.)

If you plan on using it for a longer time, immediately save it again
with the filename being identical to your character name, example: Killer.prf
if your character is named 'Killer'.
(You can save macros by choosing '(s) Save macros' in the macro menu.
Note: The example macro sets are write-protected to avoid overwriting.)

Of course you can just use any other potion/scroll instead of those mentioned,
as long as you put the according inscription on that item.
(To inscribe an item press '{' key, to uninscribe press '}'.)

Key         Purpose of the Macro                    The macro   Inscription
                                                    itself      on the item(s)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F1  fire with ranged weapon at closest target       \e)*tf-        -none-
    (you can inscribe your ammunition:  !=
    to pick it up automatically)
F2  quaff cure critical wound or healing potion     \e)q1           @q1
F3  quaff speed potion                              \e)q2           @q2
F4  quaff potion of resistance,                     \e)q3           @q3
    an important thing later in the game.
    Since these are too expensive in the beginning, you could just buy potions
    of resist heat instead which are offered for little money in store 5,
    and inscribe them @q3 accordingly. They can already be very helpful.
F5  read scroll of phase door                       \e)r1           @r1
F6  read scroll of teleportation                    \e)r2           @r2
F7  read scroll of identify                         \e)r3           @r3
F8  use a staff of teleportation                    \e)u1           @u1
    (magic device must be high enough or
    you will keep failing; also see (6.10))
F9  quaff a restore life levels potion              \e)q4           @q4
F10 zap some rod                                    \e)z1           @z1
    (magic device must be high enough or
    you will keep failing; also see (6.10))
F11 eat something.                                  \e)E1           @E1
    (Draconians could inscribe some firestones
    (see (5.9)) instead of normal food, to quickly
    boost their powers if needed.)
F12 use a magic device on the closest target        \e)*t/1-        @/1
    (Magic devices are wands, staves or rods.
    Your magic device ability must be good enough
    or you will keep failing; also see (6.10))

As you can see this fighter is supposed to be able to use quite some magic
for support in addition to fighting. Especially helpful are Rods of Perception
or of speed. Not all warriors are bright enough to use magic items easily, nor
are players always willing to spend many points on the 'Magic Device' skill.
If you dislike the use of magic your character would have to rely completely
on scrolls of teleportation instead. Just make sure you have confusion and
blindness resistance then! (Those two aren't needed to use a staff.)
If you play Draconian, kill Dragonriders because they tend to drop a large
amount of firestones. If a difficult combat starts, just eat several of them
to get a larger amount of extra powers.
(All macros in the example set were defined as hybrid macros.)


The above macro set slightly changed to fit
additional needs of a low level istar or other casters:
-------------------------------------------------------
This macro set is already in your /lib/user folder! If it's not there,
download the latest client from www.tomenet.eu or our personal pages.
You can load this macro file by hitting % to invoke the macro menu,
then enter 'l' to load a macro file, and specifying its filename,
which is depending on your operating system:

linux_caster.prf    or    windows_caster.prf
(On Mac OS X use linux_caster.prf.)

If you plan on using it for a longer time, immediately save it again
with the filename being identical to your character name, example: Killer.prf
if your character is named 'Killer'.
(You can save macros by choosing '(s) Save macros' in the macro menu.)
Note: The example macro sets are write-protected to avoid overwriting.)

Of course you can just use any other potion/scroll instead of those mentioned,
as long as you put the according inscription on that item.
(To inscribe an item press '{' key, to uninscribe press '}'.)

Key         Purpose of the Macro                    The macro   Inscription
                                                    itself      on the item(s)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F1  fire with ranged weapon at closest target       \e)*tf-        -none-
    (you can inscribe your ammunition:  !=
    to pick it up automatically)
F2  quaff cure critical wound or healing potion     \e)q1           @q1
F3  quaff speed potion                              \e)q2           @q2
F4  quaff restore mana potion                       \e)q3           @q3
F5  read scroll of phase door                       \e)r1           @r1
F6  read scroll of teleportation                    \e)r2           @r2
F7  read scroll of identify                         \e)r3           @r3
F8  use a staff of teleportation                    \e)u1           @u1
F9             \e)m@11\r@Detect Monsters\rm@11\r@Sense Hidden\r    -none-
    A combo macro: Cast spells 'Detect Monsters'
    and 'Sense Hidden' from book Beginner Cantrips.
    Since this macro casts two spells, it uses up
    two of your character's turns to complete.
    (Note that this macro uses 'cast-by-name', ie specifies the spell names
    instead of relying on book inscriptions, making it very flexible!)
F10 zap some rod                                    \e)z1           @z1
F11                                  \e)m@11\r@Globe of Light\r    -none-
    Cast Globe Of Light spell.
F12 use a magic device on the closest target        \e)*t/1-        @/1
    (Magic devices are wands, staves or rods.
    Your magic device ability must be good enough
    or you will keep failing; also see (6.10))
+                                  \e)*tm@11\r@Noxious Cloud\r-    -none-
    Cast Noxious Cloud spell on nearest target
-   Cast Phase Door.                     \e)m@11\r@Phase Door\r    -none-
0   Cast Manathrust at nearest target \e)*tm@11\r@Manathrust\r-    -none-

This low level istar might be armed with a sling to support his yet weak
magic, so the F1 macro makes sense. Assuming that he uses the numpad keys for
movement, the keys +, - and 0 were used to allow quick access to his basic
spells. - and 0 use his startup book 'Beginner Cantrips' while the macro on
the + key requires that he bought a spellbook of noxious cloud.
(All macros in the example set were defined as hybrid macros.)



(3.9) Macros with special keys
------------------------------
You can use so-called 'escapes', meaning a combination of '\' and a regular
key to emulate some special keys in your macros:
\\              the backslash itself. Prevents it from being interpreted as
                the beginning of an escape sequence.
\e              equals the 'ESC' key.
\s              equals the 'SPACE' key. You can also just type in regular
                spaces, which will be converted automatically.
\r or \n        RETURN/ENTER or LINEFEED. Makes no difference.
                Example:
                :hi!\r:hi!\n    makes your character say 'hi!' two times.
)               clears the keyboard buffer (all previous key presses that
                still have to be processed will be forgotten).
^               Prefixed to any key this will lead to a CTRL + <thatkey>
                combination. For example a macro '^q' will exit the game.

Example:
:Hi all!\r      This macro writes 'Hi all!' to everyone.
\e)*tf-         This macro will press escape to leave any potential
                running input routine, clear the buffer, fire a shot at
                the closest enemy. You can hammer this macro madly while
                playing without fear of your client processing the key
                presses forever, locking you in a position till your last
                arrow has been shot, since each time you hit the macro,
                it will clear the keyboard buffer (')' symbol) from all
                previous entries.
                The 'running input routine' means:
                If you previously pressed 'q' to quaff a potion, the game
                will now ask you 'Which potion?' and wait for your input.
                If you now see an enemy approaching before you decide which
                potion to quaff, you would usually have to press ESC to leave
                the quaffing input and start firing arrows then. By
                integrating the ESC key into the macro ('\e') this step is
                done automatically.
*I recommend to have all macros start with the '\e)' sequence.*

Miscellanous escape sequences:
\x??            Convert the hex code into an ASCII character. For example
                \x41 (hex 41, dec 65) will become the 65th character of the
                ASCII charset which is a capital 'A'.
\^              The caret '^' or 'accent circonflex'.
\b              stands for the BACKSPACE key.
\t              stands for the TABulator key.
\0?? or \1?? or \2?? or \3??
                stands for an octal code. The code will be converted into an
                ASCII character similar to \x?? hex mode, so \101 becomes 'A'.
\w??            Waits (asynchronously) for ?? tenth seconds. (eg. 20 -> 2 s)
                Use this for macros which contain several commands in a row
                which depend on each others execution. You might have to
                adjust the delay to your personal latency, depending on your
                internet connection and speed at which your character acts.
                NOTE: You must always specify TWO digits. For example if you
                      want to wait for 200 ms, you need to enter "\w02" and
                      NOT "\w2"!
                Setting a too high delay is actually not necessarily bad:
                For the most common use cases, wielding/taking off/swapping
                items or polymorphing yourself, the server will actually send
                an internal confirmation to the client when that action has
                finished processing and the client will then exit the \w delay
                early, so you're not losing any time that way. So if you have
                a network connection that suffers of continuous lag spikes it
                might even be an advantage to crank up the \w times. Actually
                you should just switch your ISP though.


(3.9a) Creating a chat macro for your party
-------------------------------------------
Using public chat for party coordination can prove annoying to other players
and as well confusing to your fellow party members since it's sometimes hard
to read if people are chatting vividly.
On the other hand, entering your chat lines in this format
  <Party name>:<Text>
all the time can get annoying since you have to repeat the party name over and
over, although you can use just the first four letters or so as abbreviation.

There are three different ways to easily talk to your party.
1.) use the party wildcard '!'.
    Simply start your chatline like this !:blabla..., using the '!' in place
    of the party name. The text will be sent to your current party (if any).
2.) Hit ':' key to enter chat, now press TAB to switch to party chat mode.
3.) Create a macro to chat with a specific party, so you can write a
    party-message by hitting a single key, party-chatting becomes as easy as
    hitting ':' for normal chat.
    Enter the macro menu ('%'), enter a new action ('a'), enter the macro
    according to your party name. For example, if your party is called
    'Scarlet Knights', enter this string:
        :Scarlet:
    hit the Enter key to accept it, create a command macro ('c'), choose a
    key you wish to use for party chat from now on, and save your macro ('s')
    to a file which is loaded automatically, like '<Your charname>.prf', for
    example Kinkan.prf.
    Using longer or shorter (at least 4 letters) strings works too of course,
    as long as there isn't a party of similar name which could get confused
    with yours.
The best way in my opinion is to combine the two ways and to set up a macro
which types   :!:   for you on a single key press automatically:
    Enter the macro menu ('%'), enter a new action ('a'), enter the macro:
        :!:
    hit the Enter key to accept it, create a command macro ('c'), choose a
    key you wish to use for party chat from now on, and save your macro ('s')
    to a file which is loaded automatically, like '<Your charname>.prf', for
    example Kinkan.prf. This way, no matter what your party is called, you
    will always be able to chat to it by pressing a single key.


(3.9b) Alternative macros: Calling objects by their name
--------------------------------------------------------
An alternative way to utilize macros is to not rely on item inscriptions, but
instead call the target object directly by its name!

This can either be an item name, as it appears in your inventory, or a spell
name if you want your macro to cast a spell.

The clue is that when you are asked "Aim which wand?", "Read which scroll?",
"Cast from which book?" etc. you can also press '@' key to directly type in
a name.
Note: In the special case of books, you will then be able to type in
a spell name instead of a book name, and the game will search your books for
that spell automatically.

So, instead of inscribing your potions of Healing '@q1' and having a macro
'\e)q1' you could also just have a macro '\e)q@Healing\r'.

Or, instead of inscribing a Beginner Cantrips book '@m1' and macroing the spell
Manathrust with '\e)*tm@11\r9a-' you could also just make a macro
'\e)*tm@11\r@Manathrust\r-' without the need to inscribe your book.

In fact you could make a macro '\e)*tm@Cast a spell\r@Manathrust\r-'.

Another example: '\e)m@11\r@Phase Door\r'.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that call-by-name is actually case-sensitive!
(So in the example above, 'Manathrust' would not work.)

Additional details:
-------------------
The text you provide for matching is treated as a partial text (sub-string)
that must occur anywhere in an inventory slot text. Only those inventory slots
are tested for this, which actually contain an item of fitting base type (tval)
for the action that is being executed.

Example: You make a macro   z@Gold-Pl\r  -this will be processed as follows:
The command is 'z' to zap a rod. So only inventory slots that contain rods will
be looked at, the rest is ignored.
Now all inventory slots that contain rods will be tested for whether they
contain the text piece 'Gold-Pl' somewhere.
So if you carry any Gold-Plated rods in your inventory they will be zapped.

Note that since it's really just all about partial-text-matching, you could
inscribe some other rods 'Gold-Pl' so the text matching would succeed, although
they aren't 'real' Gold-Plated rods. (!)



(3.10) Experience, level-ups and skill points
---------------------------------------------
By killing monsters your character gains experience. In general, harder
monsters on deeper dungeon levels give more experience than easy kills.

If your character accumulates a certain amount of experience, it will gain
a 'level-up', meaning that you become noticably more powerful than you were
until now.
Each character level requires your character to accumulate more experience
than was needed for the level before, up to millions of experience points!
All characters start the game at level 1. At level 50 they are supposed to
fight the bad boss of the game, Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.
Depending on race and class, characters need to kill a different amount of
monsters in order to reach the next level. Yeeks get experience fastest,
while Maiar are slowest. (See (6.4) and (6.5).)
The exact amounts you need are shown in the subsequent paragraph (3.10a).

Each time your character gains a new level, it also gains 5 skill
points that you can distribute on your character's skills, press 'G' to invoke
the skill chart where you can raise skills of your choice. Do this at a safe
place, so your character won't be attacked and killed while you are looking
at the skill chart. The different skills are described in (6.2). Which
skills your character may specialize in depends on his class,
and sometimes also on his race; skills that are not available to your
character's class are greyed out and cannot be raised.
On the skill chart you can press 'Up'/'Down' keys to select a skill and
'Right' key to invest one of your spare skill points into it. Choices cannot
be undone, so be careful here.
For details about skill point distribution and the different skills see (6.2).

Hanging out on easy dungeon levels compared to your character level (for
example a high level 50 character on an (to him) easy dungeon level like 60)
may result in diminishing returns of experience points for killed monsters.

On the other hand, killing monsters of higher level than the player's level
will give bonus experience.

Experience is shared automatically in 'parties', see (6.9).

Note that if your experience is drained (it will be displayed in yellow instead
of in light green to indicate that it is drained), your maximum experience ie
the amount you used to have before getting drained still profits by 10% of any
experience you gain, so it is not completely wasted if you don't have a potion
of restore life levels at hand, or some other means to restore your experience
back to normal.


Recommended minimum depths for optimal experience gain
------------------------------------------------------

These are only minimum recommended depths above which your experience gain
will - depending on your character level - suffer quite a severe reduction.
Your character might not always be strong enough to survive on these depths.
In that case, despite the experience penalty, you should consider moving to
easier dungeon levels anway until you found decent items and maxed out your
vital stats (constitution, etc).

Note: Your depth display in the bottom right corner of the main window will
indicate the appropriateness of your current depth in relation to your
character level by its colour:

- If you're on a far easier depth, it'll be dark grey, indicating that you
  cannot expect to gain experience here.

- If you're on a slightly easier depth, it'll turn yellow, to tell you that
  you're getting closer to the depth required for normal experience gain, but
  there is still a penalty.

- On the minimum required depth for normal experience gain, or deeper, it's
  plain white.

(On a side note, while Word of Recall is pending, your depth indicator will
actually turn orange, since it's also used as a Word of Recall indicator.)

Here is a list of this relation between character level and the minimum dungeon
level required for normal, non-penalised experience gain, showing some steps:

      |  70                        150  |
      |  74                        166  |
      \  75                        170  /
         80                        175
         85                        180
         90                        185
         95                        190
         98                        193
         99                   no exp gained

If you are below the optimum depth, your experience gain will decrease.
The experience gained will be multiplied by 2 / (2 + leveldifference).
So for 1 level missing to optimum depth you would get 2 / (2 + 1) = 67% of
the optimum experience, at 2 levels difference you'd get 50%, 40% at 3, etc.
At level 64 and higher, no dungeon except for the Nether Realm (see (4.5c))
will be deep enough to deliver optimal experience and your experience gain
after attaining level 66 will sharply decrease outside of the Nether Realm.
The Nether Realm is by far the deepest dungeon in the game and allows players
of very high character levels to accumulate excellent experience.

These depth restrictions regarding experience gain are applied to all dungeons
except in Ironman Deep Dive Challenge and Halls of Mandos (which is Ironman).


(3.10a) Experience point table
------------------------------
This table shows how many experience points a character needs to attain each
character level. Keep in mind that depending on choice of race and class
characters main earn experience at a faster or slower rate than others.

A character who gets his experience drained below zero will die. Ghosts (dead
players) continuously lose experience points, aka they are fading. If they fall
below zero experience points they die permanently.

At level 50, characters may still accumulate experience points until 1 point
below the experience needed for level 51. To eventually advance further they
will need to defeat the game boss, Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness (see (1.3) and
subsequent subparagraphs for details).
Since characters receive a royal title on defeating Morgoth, the level range
past level 50 are often referred to as "post-king levels", while the life time
of a character during levels 1 to 50 is often referred to as "pre-king"
accordingly.

The highest possible level is 99. Characters of level 99 are impervious to any
type of life force (aka experience) draining attacks or effects.

In general, the amount of experience points required to advance from current to
next character level tends to increase with each further level gained.
Occasionally, the subsequent level might actually require the same gain of
experience points than the previous one, but it will never require less.

(3.11) Death, ghosts and looting
--------------------------------

Death
-----
If a player dies, an automatic chardump is generated in /lib/user called
'<charname>-death.txt' (see (8.2)) which you can view with any text editor.
Also, a screenshot is made automatically, displaying your situation, saved
to '<charname>-death-screenshot.xhtml'.
(You can view xhtml files in most webbrowsers.)

Normal/everlasting characters will turn into ghosts if they die. When you
become a ghost, your title will change to 'Ghost' until you get revived.
Depending on the server configuration, ghosts of a 'normal mode' player
can usually be resurrected only 2 times, so a normal player has 3 lives
before permanently biting it.
Unworldly/hellish characters don't have a ghost and are completely destroyed
if they die.
Everlasting characters may also use the 'Instant Resurrection' feature offered
by town temples, see (4.5a), which will avoid turning into a ghost.

If a player ultimatively dies on a dungeon or tower floor, ie he didn't turn
into a resurrectable ghost but got completely erased, then that particular
floor he "perma-died" (also termed "ghost-died") on will remain static for
a while, instead of being regenerated.
This allows other players to go down there later and retrieve his items or
money, however, whatever killed him/her will probably also still be down
there!

The time a level stays static is usually 2 minutes * dungeonlevel.
Example: A player dies on -300 ft in The Orc Cave dungeon.
         In The Orc Cave, the first floor at -50ft is alreay like -500ft ie
         level 10 (compare (4.5)). The player died 5 floors deeper at -300
         so we have to add 5 more floors to 10, so the player died at dungeon
         level 15 in fact. 2 minutes times 15 = 30 minutes time for others to
         go there and pickup his loot until the level randomly changes again.

Levels below 9 (eg for Barrow-Downs less deep than -450ft) are usually exempt
from remaining static and will regenerate normally, meaning the loot is lost
after a couple of seconds.

Sauron's floor (the bottom of Mount Doom) is special and will only stay static
for 60 minutes to avoid possibly blocking other players for a long time who
want to try and defeat him.

Notes: If a player enters a static-by-death floor, the floor timer will be
       reset and start counting down the full duration again, prolonging its
       staticness. This timer-reset happens the moment a player enters that
       floor. How long he stays or when he leaves again has no effect.

       The same timing that applies for static-by-death floors is also valid
       for static-by-save&exit floors, ie floors where a player logged out
       instead of doing that in town.
       So if you logged out because your character was stuck, make sure you
       don't log on too early or you will reset the timer as mentioned above.


What happens to your loot
-------------------------
If you die, all of your items are dropped to the floor at the place of your
death. Some items from your inventory or even an item from your equipment might
get lost, but most of it should be waiting for you to pick it up again after
someone came and revived you.
Note however that if you float up or down with your ghost while noone stays on
the level to keep it, the level will usually immediately change and be lost and
all your items with it!
(Only a ghost's death or death of a character which has only 1 life will turn a
floor static as described further above.)
If you stood in a place where there is no room for your items to drop, for
example inside a dense forest (green tree fields) or mountain regions (brown ^
fields) then your items will be scattered randomly over the whole level.

Last but not least, non-validated players and characters below level 3 don't
drop their items on death, their loot will vanish forever. (The level depends
on server settings, so check them via ~d to verify.)


Ghosts
------
You can continue playing as a ghost, getting a slight experience penalty,
but that's not recommended. Instead, you should go for resurrection!
Ghosts also do not share experience with party members on the same floor.

Ghosts can float up and down freely (just hit '<' or '>' key as if you take
a staircase), so they can quickly float out of the dungeon without having to
search for staircases. However, on some servers, a ghost cannot float down to
very deep dungeon levels which he hadn't visited yet when he was still alive.
So 'Ghost-Diving' (means: simply continuing playing as a ghost) is somewhat
limited there.

That will bring you back to life at the cost of experience (35% usually).
There are 3 ways to be revived:
-the ghost can visit a temple (green '4' in town). The temple priest will also
 give him some money. The temple priest will turn the ghost away without
 resurrecting it, if the town isn't the last one visited by the player when
 he was still alive. ('The temple priest turns you away')
-another living player reads a 'Scroll of Life' when standing directly next to
 a ghost.
-another living player speaks a prayer of 'resurrection' when standing
 directly next to a ghost. The higher the resurrection spell level was,
 the less experience will be lost.
The ghost will return to the world of living under the cost of a lot of
experience but at least the player can resume playing. If the ghost dies,
the character will finally be erased permanently, watch out!

Ghosts slowly lose experience, if they go below 0 they will fade and the
player will be erased completely.

Ghosts have some special abilities, these are
-they can see invisible creatures
-life force can hardly be drained from them
-they cannot be paralyzed
-they spot warm-blooded creatures easily
-they resist darkness effects, poison, cold, blindness, fear and confusion
-they cannot be cut since they don't bleed
-they resist insanity attacks
-they can pass solid walls and mountains
-they can levitate
-they cannot use items
-they cannot carry items except for the Book Of The Dead.

Ghosts can access undead powers with 'U' (currently not available, sorry).
Those powers drain your experience. If you use them too often and run out
of experience you will fade away (your character is erased then).


Getting help
------------
Don't hesistate to ask other players online for help. You can press '@' to see
who is currently logged on. To try and get the attention of someone who seems
to be afk, you can try the  /page  command. It will make his game client beep
three times.
Write in normal chat (so everyone can read it) that you need help, the dungeon
you are in, and the depth you are on, eg: "Help! I died in Mordor -50 ft!"
Make sure your ghost is in a safe spot, preferably within walls, so most
monsters will be unable to attack you. Avoid moving around until the player you
called for a rescue confirms that he has cleared out the monsters and tells you
where you should move next.



(4) The world
=============
(4.1) Running, picking up items, fighting
-----------------------------------------
To move around, use the number pad keys 1,2,3; 4,6; 7,8,9.
You can also use the arrow keys to move, but the numpad is better since it
allows you to move diagonally too, which is very important.

If no monsters are within your line of sight, are those which are are soundly
asleep, you are able to "run".
This feature was introduced to let you quickly cross empty areas, while it will
cease to work as long as you fight monsters. To run, press SHIFT+<direction>
or type '.' followed by a direction. Running using SHIFT+<direction> will
only work if Numlock is turned off. Numlock is the key labeled 'Num' above the
number key pad on the right side of your keyboard. Usually a green lamp will
indicate whether Numlock is on or off.
An exception is the town of Bree, where you are always able to run, even if
enemies are nearby.

If you want to pick up an item from the floor, step on that field and press
'g' (or press '5' on the numpad, while NUMLOCK must be on). For more
information about finding, identifying and selling items, see (5.7).
However, note that the keys can vary depending on your system configuration.

You can attack a monster with your equipped melee weapon by simply moving on
the monster's field, ie 'bumping' into the monster.
A much better choice however, is to either just stand still and let the monster
approach you, or -if the monster is asleep- just move next to the monster
instead of bumping into it. In both situations, as soon as there is a monster
directly next to you, you will automatically attack it!
This is an important feature, called "auto-retaliation", see (4.1a) below!

If you want to use ranged attacks then you have several choices:
a) casting a magical spell ('m')
b) throwing an item at a monster (or player) ('v')
c) firing your equipped ranged weapon (sling, bow, crossbow) ('f')
d) zapping a magical rod or aiming with a magical wand ('z', 'a')
For most types of ranged attacks you'll need to designate a target.

As soon as you finish casting an attack spell or if you press 'f' to fire an
arrow/bolt/pebble/shot the game will ask you for a target or direction.
You can now either press one of the 8 direction keys to fire into that
direction, or you press the asterisk '*' followed by a 't' to designate the
closest enemy as your target, which usually is what you want.
Since version 4.4.6 the game also supports '-' to fire at a previously set
target if it still exists, or cancel the action; 4.4.6b further added the '+'
key; see (3.7d) for details about targetting.

To learn how to create a macro instead of typing all these letters every time
you want to launch a ranged attack, look at '(3.7) Creating macros for ranged
attacks', or -much simpler- at '(3.7c) The macro wizard'.


(4.1a) Auto-retaliation
-----------------------
If you stand still and an enemy is on an adjacent grid (directly next to you,
no space between you and the enemy) then your character will automatically
attack it with the equipped melee weapon.

Instead of melee attacks, you can also configure the auto-retaliator to use
other items. To do so, you use '@O...' (the letter 'O', not the number zero!)
item inscriptions:

Note: To inscribe an item press '{' key, to uninscribe press '}'.
Note: You cannot use any sort of teleportation for auto-retaliation.

Weapons:
    @Ox         Don't auto-retaliate with it.
                It's recommended for spell-casters who just wear a weapon to
                profit from its magical abilities to always inscribe it @Ox
                so it won't accidentally get destroyed when fighting a Nazgul
                and the auto-retaliator won't take over.

Ranged weapons:
    @O          Auto-retaliate with it (shooting ammo).
                (Note: @O can either be on your ammunition or on the bow.)

Magic devices:
    @O          Auto-retaliate with it. (Wands, staves, rods.)

Spellbooks:
    @Oc         You will auto-retaliate by casting the spell 'c)' from this
                book (or any other spell, change the inscription accordingly).
                IMPORTANT: If you cannot cast spells from the book or you
                inscribe an unsuitable item, auto-retaliation will be disabled
                completely!
                (If 'c' is omittted, the first spell will be chosen.)

Runes:          Auto-retaliate with the inscribed rune. The format is modifier
    @Oaa        then type. To retaliate with a combination of runes, use the
                combined rune. 'A' to activate runes for combining. Selecting
                a non-damaging runespell will disable auto-retaliation.

Mimic powers:   Use the /autoret or for short /ar command to set these up,
    /ar tg      compare (0.2b). Usage (t is optional for 'town-only'):
                /ar [t]<power>

If you want an auto-retaliation-enabling inscription to only work while you are
around a town, add a 't' after the 'O', examples: '@Ot', '@Otb'.

If you want to fall back on melee-autoretaliation in case you are out of mana,
use 'Q' symbol instead of 'O'. Examples: '@Qt', '@Qtb'.
This is useful for classes that may use attack spells yet can perform decently
in close combat, such as paladin or mindcrafter.



(4.2) Level and owner of items
------------------------------
If you press 'l' to look at an unknown item that lies on the floor, you'll
see something like this:

You see a Long Sword {?} (2d5)

The '{?}' indicates that this item has not yet been 'identified'.
That means we don't know yet if it has certain magic abilities or if it's
even cursed. We just know what we can see with our very eyes, that it is
undoubtful some Long Sword, and all Long Swords do a base damage of 2d5.
For more information about finding, identifying and selling items, see (5.7).
If you pick it up it will be displayed in your inventory like this:

e) a Long Sword {+,?} (2d5)

Note the additional '+' symbol. It means that you're now the 'owner' of that
item because you were the first one to pick it up.
Now you want to find out if the sword has any magic abilities. So you read
a Scroll Of Identify (or a Staff of Perception for example). The sword now
looks like this:

e) a Long Sword {+,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

Now we know all about it. It's a magical Long Sword (magical because its
magical to-hit and to-dam boni are not 0,0 but 1,5. That means it's an
enchanted Long Sword that magically adds +1 to your hit chance and +5 to
the damage, doing (2d5)+5 damage per hit) that requires its wielder to be
at least level 6 in order to use it.

-Now if you're the owner of the sword then you are able to use it even if your
level is lower than 6 !

-If you give this sword to someone else who is level 4
that person won't be able to use it because he's not the owner.

-If you give the sword to someone who is level 6 or higher, he will become the
new owner! Now you're unable to use the sword if you're level 5 and he gives
it back to you.

-To the owner an item has the '+' sign displayed in its name. Every other
player who looks at the item sees the owner's name instead. Example:
If you drop the sword to the ground and 'l'ook at it, you'll still see this:

e) a Long Sword {+,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

but if someone else looks at it, assuming your name is 'Mithrandir', that
person will instead read:

e) a Long Sword {Mithrandir,6} (2d5) (+1,+5)

-Last but not least a nasty scenario:
Your character (named 'Mithrandir', level 20) dies and loses his Bluesteel
Blade {+,20}. Now you're a ghost and decide to ask a fellow player (named
'Mugash', level 30) if he can defeat the monsters that killed you and bring
your items to town.
He agrees, you float up to town (remember that ghosts can simply float up
and down anytime by pressing < and >) and revive in the temple (green '4').
If you revive, you'll always lose a bunch of experience. So your level is
now 18 instead of formerly 20.
The level 30 player kills all monsters and picks up your stuff. Since your
valuable Bluesteel Blade requires level 20 the level 30 player becomes its
new owner because he's not lower than 20. He arrives in town and drops the
sword for you.
You pick it up, and whooops it's a Bluesteel Blade {Mugash,20} and you're
level 18. You can't wield it anymore! So the right choice would've been to
ask Mugash if he can buy a 'Scroll of Life' and revive you in the dungeon
after he killed off all mobs, to avoid him touching your items and becoming
the owner.



(4.3) Dungeon and tower types
-----------------------------
To enter a dungeon, you look for the staircase symbol '>', step on it and press
the '>' key to enter. Same for entering towers, except their staircase goes
upwards instead of downwards, and hence is a '<' symbol instead of '>'.

In Bree, there is often a so-called Training Tower, which is represented by a
dark green '<'. Enter it by pressing the '<' key.
The training tower allows you to 'die' without suffering major consequences
(except for a slight loss in experience and gold), and is easier in general.
An experience penalty might be applied for killing monsters in the tower
(usually 50%). You might ask other players in game (use ':' to chat) where/if
there is a newbie tower (also called 'Training Tower'), or you might search for
it yourself. It's usually in Bree, to the lower right of the town centre.

In general, when you take a staircase or use Word of Recall, your character
will temporarily get a high Armour bonus (+100) and a chance to deflect enemy
attacks and to reduce their damage, for a very short duration.
This is an extra protection (called 'stair GoI', compare (0.4)) to help
surviving nasty surprises when entering a new dungeon level.
Keep your scrolls of teleportation ready anyway!

While in a town, you can invoke a map that shows the staircases upwards
and downwards by pressing SHIFT+'M' (ie capital M).
If you leave a town and explore the wilderness, M will bring up a map showing
you towns and areas that you have explored so far.
If you are in a dungeon, M will bring up a minimap of your dungeon level
instead.
If you want to look at the world map while in town or in a dungeon, press '~'
key and choose "Wilderness map".

Before you enter a dungeon, make sure that you have equipped a light source!
Note the bright dots around you, these are lightened fields within the
radius of your light source. To look around your current dungeon/tower level
or town, press 'L' and use direction keys to move your view panel. ESC key
bring you back to normal view mode.

The wilderness actually bears many interesting dungeons apart from the usual
well known town dungeons.

When you enter the dungeon 'Barrow-Downs' in the starting town Bree, you will
note in the main window instead of "Bree" your actual depth is displayed,
telling you on which dungeon level you are. Each dungeon level is 50 feet
deeper.
Monsters have approximately the same level as the dungeon level they appear
on. You should try to figure out how deep you can go without dying.
The dungeon depth I can recommend is between 1/3 (if you are _very_ weak) of
your own character level and 3/4 of your character level. You can also go
deeper, in case you want to try diving quickly. On 750 ft you can often find
hounds (their symbol is a 'Z' for 'Zephyrs'). These don't have many hit points
but give a lot of experience, making them a valued target for divers.

For a list of dungeons and towers, see (4.5).


Dungeon types
-------------
There are different types of dungeons, indicated by different
staircase colours (also visible on the world map):

-Normal dungeons. The main dungeons below the five cities Bree, Minas Anor,
 Gondolin, Lothlorien and Khazad-dum are such regular dungeons.
 Normal dungeons/towers are marked by a white < or > symbol.

-NO_RECALL_INTO. You may not recall into this dungeon/tower. You can use
 recall to get out of it though. Probability travel works towards the surface
 but not towards the dungeon bottom/tower top. To Telekinesis the same
 restrictions apply as for NO_RECALL. Ghosts may float freely.
 Staircases are yellow.

-NO_UP. These dungeons won't allow you to go upwards, similar to ironman,
 just without the penalty of permanent ghost-death. You are allowed to use
 Word of Recall as well! Ghosts of dead players can float upwards.
 No-up dungeons/towers are marked by an orange < or > symbol.

-NO_RECALL. These dungeons don't allow you to use Word of Recall nor
 probability travel to change the level. The staircases are the only way.
 Sending items via telekinesis to a player who is currently in a no-recall
 dungeon/tower will only work if both players are on the same dungeon floor.
 Ghosts of dead players can still float up/down.
 No-recall dungeons/towers are marked by a red < or > symbol.

-FORCE_DOWN. Same as NO_UP, but you can only recall at the bottom of the
 dungeon, similar to ironman (except for the no-ghost death penalty).
 Force-down dungeons/towers are marked by a light red < or > symbol.

-Hellish. Players suffer no-ghost deaths inside hellish dungeons.
 Even if they're everlasting, meaning that if you die in such a dungeon or
 tower you won't turn into a ghost either but get destroyed completely.
 Hellish dungeons/towers are marked by a fire-like flickering < or > symbol
 (red/yellow).

-Ironman. Same as hellish. Also:
 Ironman dungeons or towers won't allow you to recall or to use
 staircases that lead upwards or probability travel backwards!
 Sending items via telekinesis to a player who is currently in an ironman
 dungeon/tower will only work if both players are on the same dungeon floor.
 To leave an ironman dungeon/tower you'll have to get to it's bottom or top
 respectively. There might be possibilities to use Word of Recall even if
 you're not at bottom/top yet, depending on the server/dungeon type.
 In general you will recognize levels which allow recalling by a green message,
 saying "You don't sense a magic barrier here..." (compare (4.8)).
 Ironman dungeons/towers are marked by a dark grey < or > symbol.

 NOTE: In the case of Ironman-server settings, you can usually recall INTO town
 dungeons every (n*1000)+50 ft, n starting at 0. Example: -50 ft, -1050 ft,
 -2050 ft, etc. Also, ALL dungeons will usually not allow recalling OUT until
 you reach a floor that is equivalent to at least dungeon level 20. Examples:
 At least -1000 ft in Barrow-Downs, at least -550 ft in The Orc Cave.
 (See (8.6) for more information about Ironman settings.)

-NO_DEATH. The Training Tower in Bree has this flag. Players who die inside a
 no-death dungeon won't turn into a ghost if they 'die' but just be teleported
 back to town! They still lose about 20% experience (and gold) though.
 No-death dungeons/towers are marked by a green < or > symbol.

-Unescapable dungeons. There is usually only one such dungeon and that is the
 'Death Fate'. Its entrance is a dark-flickering staircase. You should avoid
 this dungeon at all costs since once you enter you can never get out.
 If it's indeed the 'Death Fate' one then it's only one floor in size, so you
 will just starve to death without anything interesting happening in there.
 (The 'Death Fate' dungeon is actually not an ironman dungeon.)

-Experimental dungeons. There might be an experimental dungeon available, which
 has special flags that are very unusual:
 NO_TELE, NO_ESP, LIMIT_ESP, NO_SUMMON.
 These can prevent teleportation, ESP, limit ESP vision to radius 10, prevent
 all kind of summoning (especially monsters summoning more monsters!).
 Such experimental dungeons have light umber coloured staircases (same colour
 as is used for maxed stats/abilities, ie light brown).
 Experimental dungeons do not belong to the canon game and you enter on your
 own risk! (Well, you actually enter any dungeon at your own risk, so..)

If a dungeon has several of these flags, the latter ones will override the
staircase colour. So a hellish NO_RECALL_INTO dungeon has hellish-looking
staircases.

Sometimes you might find ruins of old staircases that don't lead to any
dungeon or tower. Those have no further functionality and are coloured grey
(make sure you don't confuse them with an ironman dungeon accidentally).

If you're looking for a challenge dungeon regarding deep diving without
recalling in between, you might want to check out 'The Halls of Mandos'
or the 'Ironman Deep Dive Challenge' (see (4.13) for details).

(Note: Staircase directions - ie upwards/downwards - are inverted for towers.)


(4.3a) The jail
---------------
The jail is a dedicated house that does not allow imprisoned characters to
escape until a timer runs out, after which they will be freed.

The jail was originally built for punishment of the following felonies -
although depending on the server's configuration some might be disabled while
others might get added:
    -Swearing
     Still the most common felony, it will usually only result in a pretty
     short time of imprisonment.
     Foul language will be filtered by '*' characters to other players, except
     if they have turned the filter off in their clients (also see (3.3)).
     It's possible that not all foul language might result in jailing, but most
     of it certainly will.
    -Spamming the chat (aka 'talking too much')
     Very rare to trigger, also results in a pretty short time of imprisonment.
    -On server settings where players have to declare that they are ready for
     pvp, attacking a non-pvp player will result in a long time of imprisonment
     Trying to shoot someone who's on a safe grid will also result in a medium
     duration of imprisonment.
     (These settings are not enabled on the main servers.)

If you commit multiple felonies, whether you are already in jail or not, the
punishment adds up (except that it doesn't matter how many swear words occured
in one chat message).

There can be multiple jails. The player will be imprisoned in the one closest
to him. Also, players will only get caught if they are getting close to a town.
If you are far away from town, your punishment will be delayed until you move
close to a town gain, then you will be jailed "for old crimes" accordingly.

Note that jails (if the server has one) don't allow any sort of teleportation,
nor will you turn into a ghost if you get killed there, instead you will get
destroyed completely (basically same as if you were a no-ghost mode char).

A jail usually has an ironman tower or dungeon inside. It has no deeper meaning
and is certainly not required or recommended to take. If you're up for a pretty
hard extra challenge and take it, you'll be a free man or woman if you make it
out alive, though.



(4.4) Terrain
-------------
Terrain features in the main window:
------------------------------------
Town buildings-
Consisting of red or yellow '#' (roof) and white '#' (wall), these cannot be
damaged or destroyed and some of them contain the basic town stores (numbers
1 to 9 marking the entrance) as well as special stores (+ sign marking the
entrance). See (4.5) for details about stores.

Floor-
Dots '.' rensemble empty floor. Green dots are grass, brown ones dirt, grey
ones stone or ash. Note that the colour also depends on the season - in summer
or autumn, some grass might appear as yellow, when it's been suffering in the
heat. ;)
Red dots are lava, violet dots nether mist. These can be dangerous to cross!
See a bit below for more details.

Trees and bushes-
Thick trees are rensembled by (mostly green, depending on the season) '#'.
To pass them you need to either levitate over them or to be an Ent, shepherd of
trees to whom they will slightly bow aside to make room, a yeek, or a trained
ranger or druid. Trees can also be burned up. Dead trees and bushes are '*'
symbols.

Staircases-
'<' and '>' are staircases leading upwards or downwards into towers or
dungeons. (Press the according key to walk the staircase. Whenever you take a
staircase, you'll receive the 'stair GoI' buff, see (0.4) for details on that.)

Doors-
Light brown '+' are closed doors, ' are open or broken doors.
(Use 'o' to open, 'c' to close and 'B'/'F' to bash/force doors.)

Void Jumpgates-
Violet '+' are void jumpgates that teleport you elsewhere.
Press '>' key to use them.

Stores-
Store entrances are represented by coloured numbers '1'..'7', '9' and '+'.
See (4.5) for details about stores.

Rubble-
':' is rubble. Characters with high enough archery skill who use a sling-type
weapon can stand next to rubble and use their 'Craft Ammunition' ability to
create sling ammunition from it.

Dark Pits-
Dark grey '^' are pits that can only be crossed if you have feather falling or
levitation ability. Bree is protected by pits around the outer tree wall.
These pits cannot be disarmed (because they don't count as trap, as opposed to
the actual 'chasm traps' and 'pit traps') or destroyed.

Walls-
White '#' are permanent walls which cannot be damaged or destroyed, or in
some special places can be ice walls (which can be destroyed).
'#' and '%' of different grey tones are granite walls, magma intrusions,
quartz veins and can be tunneled into and take damage from earthquakes.
Yellow '#' are sand walls, red/brown '#' are indestructible lava walls which
may occur in some remote places..

Water-
On the world surface but also in some dungeons there's lots of water (blue '~'
fields). It can be dangerous to cross it if you're not good at swimming or if
you cannot levitate :) Further, nasty creatures are said to live in the seas.
Ents cannot drown in water since they completely consist of wood.

Mountain chains-
Brown '^' fields are massive and very high mountains. To travel these you need
a climbing set or another item that gives you climbing abilities. Dwarves can
intrinsically travel through mountains. In dungeons '^' rensemble solid
structures of massive rock that reach nearly up to the top of the huge dungeon
levels, climbing these is as hard as climbing mountains above ground.
White '^' are extremely high mountain chains that cannot be climbed.

Lava-
Red dots '.' are shallow lava, which will do heat damage to your character in
regular intervals.
Red/orange/yellow '~' is deep lava, which deals a lot of heat damage.
The fire damage lava inflicts might also destroy items in your inventory in
case you're not immune to fire or at least double-resist fire - potions of
resist heat are a cheap way to attain double resistance for a short time.
(See (5.6) for more information about resistances, double resistance and
(5.10) for details about item destruction by elemental effects.)

Fountains-
'_' are fountains. To drink from them use /sip command or press the '_' key.
See (0.2) for more details.

Nether mist-
Violet dots designate nether mist. However, this usually only occurs in the
Nether Realm, a place which is exclusively accessible to winners.
Nether mist deals nether damage periodically, similar to how lava deals fire
damage.

(*) You could get stuck in the trees if you enter such a sector;
    a digging tool or just using a sword or axe will allow you to hack down
    the trees relatively easily though to get you out of there.
    Note that levitation also allows you to pass trees easily.
(**) You might get stuck in there if you enter such a sector without being
     able to climb. Especially nasty in case of volcanos, since the fiery
     ground might burn your items. Use Word of Recall to get out of here.
(***) If your backpack is too heavy for you to swim then it'll be a big hassle
      to try and cross deep water without drowning. In that case just get an
      item that allows you to levitate and you'll be fine. (See (4.15) for
      details about swimming).



(4.5) Towns, shops, the dungeons and dungeon bosses
---------------------------------------------------
To view a list of all towns and dungeons you have discovered, press ~ 8 .
Dungeons which have a dedicated final boss will indicate at the end of the
line whether you have "conquered" them yet (aka slain that boss) or not.

If you create a new character, it will start in 'Bree', a town located at
position 32,32 on the world map (same position on all servers!).

The world map, ranging from 0,0 (bottom left corner) to 63,63
(top right corner), bears several other towns that you can find and
explore. These towns often contain different shops (some are said to offer
*Identify* service or even a cure to Black Breath) and harder dungeons.

However, they might also be a very dangerous place to stay, compared to Bree.
In general you can say the harder the local dungeon entrance of a town the
more dangerous monsters can spawn within the town! Bree is the only town that
contains just more or less harmless townsfolk.
The worst are Khazad-dum and Lothlorien, if you go there be _very_ cautious.
Monsters that appear here might look like harmless novice paladins or snagas
but are in fact of a higher level and more powerful. Also, dangerous monsters
can spawn in those towns: While Gondolin and Minas Anor can already have nasty
Mindcrafters, Khazad-Dum and Lothlorien may also spawn the infamous Grand
Swordsmasters which have killed many characters that went AFK outside the inns.
However, it has been observed that people who figured out how to climb high
mountains travelled to Khazad-dum despite their low level for a strange
reason >:-).
Even if you decide to stay in Gondolin, which is relatively harmless,
don't go afk for a longer time or even a snaga archer might kill you with his
ranged attacks. Always a nasty surprise..

Despite the hazards of higher level towns, towns in general act as a safe zone,
preventing PK/PvP attacks (ie attacks done by a player against another player)
and stop your character's food consumption, meaning that you cannot die by
starvation while in town. Towns also put experience drain on hold, which is
important for players wearing Nazgul Rings Of Power for example.
Dungeon towns behave like normal towns in these regards.


(4.5a) Shops and their services
-------------------------------
Each town has several shops, displayed as numbers 1..9 and some '+'.
The 1..9 are standard shops, namely..
1       General Store   Sells food, lanterns, ammunition, cloaks and shrooms.
2       Armoury         Offers various basic armour. Rarely excellent pieces.
3       Weapon Shop     Offers various basic weapons. Rarely excellent pieces.
4       Temple          Player ghosts will be revived here, and receive some
                        money. The temple also sells a selection of blunt
                        weaponry, scrolls and potions.
                        The temple priest will also attempt to cure, heal or
                        feed you if you enter the temple in bad condition.

                        Since 4.4.9 the temple also offers you to toggle
                        'Instant Resurrection', a new feature that is only
                        available for everlasting players and will immediately
                        resurrect a player at the temple when he dies, removing
                        the need to wait for some other player to come and
                        rescue him. In turn, the experience penalty will be
                        50% instead of the usual 35%. Insta-res also keeps all
                        your items except for the usual chance to lose a few of
                        them on death, which is the same as for normal deaths.
                        However, the player will need to have enough cash to
                        pay an instant resurrection fee when he dies, which is:
                        Dungeonlevel * dungeonlevel * 10 + 10 gold pieces.
                        The money is automatically deducted from the purse or
                        the bank account as required. If the player does not
                        have enough money in total then resurrection will fail
                        and the player will remain a ghost in the dungeon as
                        usual when not using instant resurrection.
                        Instant resurrection does not work in no-ghost dungeons
                        (ie ironman or hellish) and dungeon levels (ie floors
                        where Morgoth is) or in the Nether Realm.
5       Alchemist       Sells various scrolls and potions.
6       Magic Shop      Sells wands, staves, rings and amulets.
7       Black Market    Sells many different items, mostly very good ones.
                        This shop is very expensive and buys for very little
                        in return. Better not sell your items to this shop,
                        as long as a regular store will pay you better.
                        Some items cannot be sold elsewhere though.
8       The Inn         In Bree it's The Prancing Pony. Inside the inn,
                        players are relatively safe from monsters.
9       Book Store      Sells books for istari, priests and all other (hybrid)
                        magic users. Book stores in higher-level towns on
                        average also tend to sell higher-level spells.
+       These are different everywhere. Some examples are mainly..
        Mayor's Office (in Bree)
                        Allows you to turn in deed parchments you won in
                        tournaments or on other occasions for a reward.
                        Also, you can receive an extermination order here
                        (see (4.13) about those).
                        Last but not least you can check out a list of
                        noteworthy occurances that may happened lately.
        The Merchants Guild
                        An NPC run guild that offers two services,
                        a bank account to deposit your money in so you won't
                        lose it accidentally on a dungeon trip,
                        and a mail service that allows you to send money or an
                        item to other players.
                        Several towns have a subsidiary, you can globally
                        access your bank account and mail from any of those.
        Rune Repository
                        Sells and buys runes used by Runemasters.
        Casino          Minas Anor has a casino. Go and try your luck!
                        (There are various gambling opportunities, and also
                        the ancient board game 'Go' which can be played on a
                        9x9 board for a one-time fee on each difficulty level.
                        Get your Go game records emailed to you via "/kifu".)
                        For details about the gambling rules of the casino, see
                        subsequent (4.5a2) paragraph.
        Mass Identify Service
                        Will identify all items you currently carry for a fee.
                        See (5.7) for more information about identification.
        *Identify* Service
                        Will *identify* an item for a fee.
                        See (5.7) for more information about ID, *ID*, shops!
        Herbal Healing Service
                        Will cure black breath for a high fee. (See (1.3a) for
                        more information about Black Breath.)
        Morph Restoration Service
                        Restores your form to normal in case you were
                        polymorphed (for example by a potion of Chauve-Souris).
        Enchant Services
                        These will enchant weapons, arrows, or armour you have
                        equipped.
                        For weapons, this will attempt to enchant a main-hand
                        or off-hand (if dual-wielding) weapon, for armour this
                        will look through all armour slots. When an eligible
                        item is found, it will be enchanted.
                        Cursed items, artifacts and items that cannot be
                        enchanted are not eligible and will be skipped.

                        Only one item is enchanted at a time, so if you have
                        three enchantable pieces of armour that aren't in
                        perfect state, you'll have to take the enchant service
                        three times.

                        The resulting enchantment bonus of the item is your
                        character level divided by 5 and 5 added to that, with
                        the result capped at a maximum of +20, therefore
                        reached at level 75.
                        At level 50 the enchantment would be 50/5 + 5 = 10 + 5
                        = 15, which is the maximum enchantment reachable by
                        using *enchant* scrolls.
                        Ammunition can never be enchanted above (+15,+15).

                        Note that enchant services will not break curses.
        Mining Supply Store
                        In the hazardous city of Khazad-Dum is a store that
                        offers some goods found to be useful by the miners
                        in the mountain depths.
        Donate gold and pray to the gods  (EXPERIMENTAL: allows to solo reking)
                        This is a special option in The Mirror in Lothlorien
                        which allows fallen kings and queens to get their fate
                        changed by the gods: Their Morgoth kill will be undone
                        so they may challenge him once more, to regain their
                        royal title!
                        (In game slang, this is called 'solo-rekinging'.)
                        This service is useful if you do not have any team mate
                        who still hasn't killed Morgoth yet, to kill Morgoth in
                        a party together with him, which is the traditional way
                        of obtaining a lost royal title again.

                        To gain the favour of the gods and have your fate
                        changed you will need to donate at least 5 million gold
                        pieces.
                        In addition to this you can either donate another 5
                        million or you can wait for about 2 weeks (real time,
                        you don't even need to be logged on!) or you can
                        gain about 5 million raw experience points or a mix of
                        all these, up to your personal preference.
                        'Raw' experience means that it's simply the amount of
                        experience shown in the monster spoiler (~7) and the
                        only other factors are the monster's clone state and
                        you being on appropriate depth (grey depth indicator
                        will prevent gain completely and a yellow one will
                        reduce gain accordingly).
                        Your race and class which may usually diminish your
                        experience gain (worst for Maiar) do NOT factor in, so
                        the amount of monster slaying is exactly the same for
                        everyone. However, YOU will need to kill the monster!
                        Kills done by party members will not count for you.
                        So even if your character is at the exp cap at level 50
                        and does not seem to gain any more experience, this
                        'raw experience' will still accumulate and count for
                        obtaining the favour of the gods.

                        If you are sure that you have already donated at least
                        5 million gold pieces and are now working on killing
                        monsters or alternatively just sitting it out, you can
                        check back in The Mirror anytime without donating any
                        more gold (just choose to donate 0 gold pieces) until
                        it tells you in a bright green message that your fate
                        has finally been changed.
                        ("You feel your fate has been changed!")

                        The conversion rates are, as mentioned above:
                        1 minute of time passed = 250 Xp = 250 Au.
                        Some random examples to gain the gods' favour:
                        a) pay 10M straight.
                        b) pay 5M, wait for about 2 weeks.
                        c) pay 2M, wait for about a week, gain 2.5M raw exp,
                           pay 3M more.
                        d) gain 4M raw exp, pay 6M gold.

        ..and various miscellaneous store services, of which some currently may
        not have an actual effect.


Price limits:
-------------
Shops that buy and sell items will have a price limit that they will pay for
an item a players wants to sell. The limit varies from 50,000 to 300,000 Au
depending on the shop owner. The shop owners change regularly, if a shop makes
you a bad offer (the cap price) just wait for the owner to change or visit a
different shop. Shops in different towns are run by different owners although
they may use the same number '1'..'9' and '+' for their entrance symbols.
If the item is worth more than 300,000 Au maybe you can find a fellow player
who is wealthy and in urgent need of your items.


Item orders
-----------
The basic town stores also allow you to order specific basic items that they
usually offer in their store template. These items will come without any
hit/damage/ac enchantments or ego powers, but in their plain versions.
To order an item, enter a store that provides this option:
  'o) Order an item'
Then specify number and name of the item, examples:
  potion of restore strength
  20 scrolls of identify
  spell crystal of psionic blast
and you will be prompted with the price you'd have to pay upfront, then you
can accept or decline. If you accept, the money will be deduced from your purse
and the shopkeeper will let you know how long the delivery of your order will
approximately take, in in-game time. So if it takes "about an hour" that will
be much less in real world time for you to wait.
Note that for spells and runes you don't need to type out the full item name!
Just typing the spell name or rune name will be sufficient.

Items that are very common in that store will cost about the same amount of
money that you'd pay when buying them the regular way, while items that occur
only very rarely in a shop can be much more expensive to order.
Ordering a pile of items instead of just one will prolong the delivery time.
You can only have one order in process at any time. If you want to order a
different item you will have to wait until your order is delivered and fetch
it.

When you enter a shop where you had an order placed and the item has arrived
then it will be automatically placed in your inventory. If you meanwhile
purchase the same type of item in the shop's regular stock that will not affect
your delivery in any way.
The delivered item will carry an inscription containing the shop name.
It is possible that the item arrives earlier than expected, as part of the
store's regular stock. In that case the shop owner will inform you and hand you
out as many of those items as possible (if you have ordered a pile of them),
that amount will then automatically be deduced from your outstanding order.


Shop scumming:
--------------
Shops regularly change their inventory on a random basis: Roughly every 33
seconds there is a chance that some items might get dropped and/or some new
items might get added to the store inventory.
This "store maintenance" stacks up to 10 times while no player is actually
visiting the store.
That means that shop-scumming can be done as fast as checking every ~33 seconds
for best results if you don't mind the effort, and on the other hand allows for
pretty relaxed scumming by checking about every 5 1/2 minutes.
Or anywhere between 33 seconds and 5 1/2 minutes, as you personally prefer.

See (5.7) for more information about ID, *ID* and shops!


(4.5a2) The casino
------------------
The casino is a very special 'store', located in Minas Anor and in the special
dungeon towns in the Ironman Deep Dive Challenge at 2000 and 4000 ft.

It provides a variety of games that you can play for money.
Most of these are pure luck, but there's also the ancient board game of Go,
which you can play on a 9x9 board.

Below you'll find the gamling rules, you can also view these in-game when
entering the casino and pressing 'r' there:

           |          Tome-NET Gambling Rules            |
           +---------------------------------------------/

Welcome to the TomeNET Casino!

Currently, two games 'In Between' and 'Craps' are available for playing.
('Spin the Wheel' and 'Dice Slots' are under construction.)
Some games playable among players are planned for the future (I hope).


For all the games, you can bet up to 1000*level AU per game, except for
players below level 10 who can bet up to 100*level AU.
The game of Go has fixed bets for each stage that you cannot change.


==============================================================================
1. 'In Between'

Three 10-faced dice are used for this game. Two black, one red.

First, the dealer rolls the two black dice.
Then you roll the red die - you win if the roll is 'in between' the two black
dice and you'll receive the payoff at odds of 3 to 1.

eg.
if two black dice are 4 and 7, and you rolled 6, you win.
if two black dice are 2 and 9, and you rolled 1, you lose.
if two black dice are 2 and 9, and you rolled 2, you lose.


==============================================================================
2. 'Craps'

Two 6-faced (cube) dice are used for this game.

You cast the two dice; if the sum of rolls is 7 or 11, you win at once.
if the sum is 2, 3 or 12, you lose at once(craps!).

If the sum isn't one of the numbers above, you cast them once more.
If the sum matches to the first sum, you win.
If the sum is 7, you lose.
In all the other cases, you reroll till you roll the first sum or 7.

If you win, you'll be paid at odds of 1 to 1.

eg.
[2, 3](5) {first roll}
[3, 3](6) {reroll - still not settled}
[4, 1](5) {you win}

[5, 6](11) {you win with the first roll}

3. 'Go challenge'

Two different short video tutorials on YouTube:
http://youtu.be/qhBQasS5IRI
http://youtu.be/gECcsSeRcNo
Nice read: http://users.eniinternet.com/bradleym/America.html
On Android (free): Go Free or GOdroid, on iOS: Little Go or Igowin for example.
Western online Go servers (english language): www.gokgs.com, www.online-go.com.

You will play the ~3000 year old asian strategy game of Go, also often
dubbed 'the divine game', on a 9x9 board against an opponent that gets
picked for you based on your past results, for cold hard money!

You pay a wager only once on each of the 8 difficulty levels. You may then
play for free until you manage to win on your current level. If you win you
will be paid twice your bet and advance into the next difficulty level.

Progress: Two players take turns placing black and white stones on the board
respectively. Those stones cannot be moved once placed, they can however be
captured (explained below). There is no limit to the stone supply.
Black moves first (which is an advantage).

Goal (chinese rules):
Surround as much 'territory' as possible with your stones (territory just
means an area of the board). Each grid you surround counts 1 point, and
every stone you place also counts 1 point. The player who ends up with more
territory wins.
(Note: Online Go servers and tournaments usually use japanese rules by default:
Under those rules, your own stones don't count as points but in turn prisoners
count as points. The result is almost always the same as under chinese rules!
The reason the casino uses chinese rules is that japanese rules are more
troubling for Go bots to handle.)

Capturing: A stone has up to four 'liberties', which means free board grids
adjacent to it: North, south, east and west. If the opponent places a stone
on the last liberty of your stone, it is removed from the board.
Friendly stones that are adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically
(just not diagonally) count as 'connected' and share their liberties,
forming chains of stones that can grow quite large and end up with a lot of
liberties. A chain of stones is also captured accordingly if ALL of its
shared liberties are occupied by opponent stones.
Note that stones on the edges of the board have less than 4 liberties.

Ko rule ('Eternity'): Repetition of a board position is forbidden. If you
want to 'capture back' (common application of the Ko rule), you will have
to play elsewhere first to change the board layout.

Pass: If a player wishes to skip his turn (usually pointless except at the
end of the game) he may pass instead of playing a stone.

End of the game:
-A player may lose on time if his clock runs out before he made a move.
-A player may resign the game if he feels he's too far behind.
-If a player feels there are no more good moves left to play, he passes.
 Now if both players pass consecutively then the game ends and the territory
 of each player on the board is counted to determine who wins.
 (If white passes first, he gets +1 point added to his final score. This sort
 of makes up for black's advantage of playing the first move in the game.)

Examples on a 5x5 board (o = stone, . = free grid):
WHITE stones are written as 'x' and BLACK stones as 'o'.

ooox.
o.ox.  The black group has only 1 liberty left (the '.' inside),
ooox.  if w plays on that '.' the whole black group is therefore captured.
xxxx.  The white group has 8 liberties on its outside so it's quite safe yet.
.....

.o..o  Due to having at least 'two eyes' (two _separated_ enclosed liberties)
..ooo  neiter group can be captured since it would require two moves at once.
oooxx  A group that has at least two eyes is therefore said to be 'alive'.
xxxx.  Since there is nothing left to do, both players will pass and the game
x.x..  ends. The score is: black 13 - white 12. Black wins by 1 point.

Strategy:
-Stones have a balance between securing territory (if they stand lower, ie on
 3rd line) and radiating influence (if they stand higher, ie 4th line or more,
 which can't really happen well on small boards such as 9x9 though).
-Moves on the first line should be avoided in the beginning of the game,
 because they neither secure territory below them, nor do they have influence
 because they are much too far away from the centre.
-Typical opening moves on 9x9 are within the imaginary square C3,C7,G7,G3.
 Other moves, ie moves on the 1st or 2nd board lines, are too close to the edge
 to be good openers.
-Separate & Connect is an important principle:
 Cut stones of your opponent apart from each other if possible.
 Keep your own stones somewhat in connection, so they can support each other.
-Note that the Ko rule (see above) prevents you from immediately recapturing a
 single stone of your opponent, which just captured your own stone, since the
 previous board position would be repeated by that. So, play elsewhere first,
 then you may recapture.
-Usually Go is played on a 19x19 board, which allows for a huge amount of
 strategy. Smaller boards are used for non-serious games, 9x9 somewhat common,
 whereby the games become purely tactical and lack much of the 19x19 strategy.

You can use the /kifu command to have the game email you your Go game records!

Enjoy!


(4.5b) Towns & town dungeons
----------------------------
Here is a list of towns and their corresponding local dungeons:
NOTE: Minimum level requirements for entering are usually disabled in normal
      server settings, so you can enter any dungeon anytime, if you dare.

Town        |Depth/Level|   Local dungeons    | Depth/Level      |Required
            |of the town|                     | of the local     |player level
            |itself     |                     | dungeon          |for entering

Bree        |   0 ft/  0|The Training Tower   | +50..+100/ 1..2  |    1
            |           |Barrow-Downs         |  50..1750/ 1..35 |    1
Gondolin    |1000 ft/ 20|Mordor               |1700..3300/34..66 |   15
Minas Anor  |2000 ft/ 40|The Paths of the Dead|2000..3500/40..70 |   20
Lothlorien  |3000 ft/ 60|Angband              |3350..6350/67..127|   30
Khazad-dum  |4000 ft/ 80|Angband              |3350..6350/67..127|   30

To enter a dungeon your character must have the displayed minimum level.
Otherwise you'll get a message like this "Suddenly you're grasped by an
uncontrollable fear".

The deeper you decend into the dungeons, the more the passing of time itself
will be slowed down to make it easier to fight very fast monsters. By the time
your character enters those depths, it should already have boosted speed so
the slowdown won't bother you but come in handy. For example if you enter
Mordor you will notice a slowdown to to approx. 1/2 standard time.
See (4.14) for more information about the in-game time system.

Some advice regarding towns and town dungeons can be found at (7.6).


(4.5c) Dungeons
---------------
This paragraph is about dungeons that don't belong to any town.
For dungeons that belong to specific towns, see the paragraph 'Towns' above.

The staircase colour of a dungeon indicates the dungeon type, compare (4.3).

'Depth/Level' describe a dungeon's starting level and final level. Depth is
actually just a different way for expressing a dungeon floor level, so they're
redundant: Each dungeon level corresponds to 50 ft.

So for example Orc Cave starts at dungeon level 10 and ends at dungeon level 23
which means:
The first floor (ie -50 ft) in The Orc Cave is the same difficulty level as the
tenth floor (ie -500 ft) in the Barrow-Downs dungeon (which starts at level 1).
Since The Orc Cave goes from level 10 to level 23 that means it has 14 floors,
so its final floor will be -700 ft which is of the same difficulty level as
-1150 ft Barrow-Downs (ie level 23).

NOTE: Minimum level requirements for entering are usually disabled in normal
      server settings, so you can enter any dungeon anytime, if you dare.

(**) Minimum level requirements are usually disabled, so you can actually
enter any dungeon you like at any character level.

The official main server usually has one or several 'ironman' dungeons
(see (4.8)), their entrances (stairs) waiting to be discovered by some bold
explorers.
Such custom dungeons appear as 'Wilderness' in the "Recall depths and Towns"
list, and usually have no minimum required character level to enter.
There may also be certain special dungeons, related to events or jails, that
show up under according names in the list.

(***) Death Fate:
You cannot escape this dungeon, ever. Any character that enters it is fated to
die to monsters (unlikely) or starvation (very likely).

(****) Cloud Planes details:
-To enter the Cloud Planes a player must carry the 'King'/'Queen' title,
 acquired by beating Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.

(*****) Nether Realm details:
-To enter the Nether Realm a player must carry the 'King'/'Queen' title,
 acquired by beating Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.
-Each floor in the Nether Realm gives a +2% bonus to experience from monster
 kills. So hunting at -350ft in there will give a +14% exp bonus. (This bonus
 is actually multiplied by the usual floor boni, instead of added. So you will
 get even much more exp when hunting on a floor with a lot of 'bad' special
 flags.)
 To any floor experience boni that might occur, an additional 5% bonus is added
 because the whole dungeon is flagged NO_RECALL_INTO, meaning it cannot be
 entered via Word of Recall (you may recall out of it though).
-Note that the amount of experience is already very high even without this
 depth-bonus, since creatures in the Nether Realm are of a very high level.
-Instant resurrection does not work in the Nether Realm.

(******) Halls of Mandos details:
-Getting out of the Halls of Mandos will be complemented with an entry
 into 'Noteworthy Occurances' list.
-Extermination orders in the Halls of Mandos will (same as for the IDDC) have
 its monster level depend on the floor level rather than on the player's level.
-Also same as in IDDC, minimum floor depth vs character level regarding
 experience gain is not enforced: Normal experience is gained on any depth
 regardless of your character's level.
-The Halls of Mandos are barred to any unique monsters!


(4.5c2) Example dungeon depth relations
---------------------------------------
Here are some examples of relations of dungeon level difficulties.

This does not take into account the dungeon 'theme', ie types of walls, floors
and other terrain and preferred/disallowed monster types.
It is purely about the depth, ie the dungeon floor level, and therefore the
basic average monster level encountered on those dungeon floors.
(The average level of monsters you can expect there is always the same as the
level of the dungeon floor. With a few random exceptions sometimes.)

-The Orc Cave -50ft is same depth as Barrow-Downs -500ft, aka dungeon level 10.

-Mordor -50ft is dungeon level 34, while Barrow-Down's deepest floor at -1750ft
 is actually dungeon level 35 (1750ft/50ft).

-Path of the Dead -50ft is dungeon level 40, which is the same dungeon level as
 Mordor -350ft, ie 6 levels 'deeper' (34*50ft + 6*50ft).

-Angband -50ft is dungeon level 67, while Mordor's deepest floor at -1650 is
 dungeon level 66. Pretty seamless.

-Path of the Dead bottom at -1550ft is the same dungeon level as Angband -200ft
 ie dungeon level 70.


(4.5d) Dungeon bosses
---------------------
Most dungeons have a dungeon boss at the final floor, which in most cases has a
chance to drop a specific artifact. In most cases the chance to drop it is 1/3.
The bosses have different probabilities to appear, but none of them is overly
rare (Azog being one of the rarer ones), so just reset the level a couple of
times until you find the boss (by leaving the level, waiting for a little bit,
then entering it again).
Dungeon bosses have especially high hit points and yield an extraordinary
amount of experience points when you defeat them. Apart from the specific
artifact drop the higher level ones also tend to drop great items in general.

Of course you can only find an artifact if it is currently not on the list of
known artifacts ie if noone else is currently in possession of it.
Even if you don't get an artifact, some of the dungeon bosses have 'DROP_GREAT'
flag, which means you will usually get especially good loot from them.

Dungeon bosses will bump the floor feeling up to at least 'special', same as
any other unique monsters do (see (4.8) for more info about floor feelings).

Here is a list of all dungeon bosses and the artifacts they are guarding:
(Some names have been shortened to fit.)

Dungeon, sorted by depth     |          Boss         |       Artifact

Moria                        |  Balrog of Moria      | Quarterstaff 'Ruyi Bang'
The Small Water Cave         |  Watcher in the Water | Trident of Wrath
Submerged Ruins              |  Ar-Pharazon          | Amulet 'Toris Mejistos'
The Illusory Castle          |  King in Yellow       | Helm of Knowledge
The Sacred Land Of Mountains |  T'ron  (level 72!)   | Coat of T'ron
Erebor                       |  Smaug                | Arkenstone of Thrain
Dol Guldur            (***)  |  Shadow of Dol Guldur | Ring of Durin
Mount Doom            (***)  |  Sauron, the Sorceror | -
The Cloud Planes             |  The Living Lightning | -
Nether Realm                 |  Zu-Aon               | Ring of Phasing

(*) Angband does not have a designated final boss, but the unique monster
Tik'srvzllat does not appear before depth 127. Since Angband ends at depth 127,
you can find him on the final floor (if he actually spawns).
In this light, Tik'srvzllat could be seen as Angband's final boss.

Also, Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness is encountered in Angband at -1700 ft or
deeper. See (1.3), (1.3a) and (1.3b) for more information.

(**) A space-time anchor is an anti-teleportation field of radius 12 that will
prevent all teleportation and stall all Word of Recall attempts within.

(***) While Sauron, the Sorceror, boss of Mount Doom, does not drop any
specific artifact, he is still a required kill before you are able to encounter
Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness (compare (1.3), (1.3a) and (1.3b)).
When you kill Sauron, you will be able to recall out from that dungeon level!
(Usually you cannot recall into/out of Mt Doom.)
Note: If you kill Sauron, you will automatically also get kill credit for the
Shadow of Dol Guldur, meaning that the Shadow won't spawn for you anymore if
you didn't kill it before killing Sauron.

(****) The Halls of Mandos are barred to ANY unique monsters!



(4.6) Pits and vaults
---------------------
Usually monsters are found on their corresponding depth. You can press ~7 to
find out which monster occurs where. However there are some exceptions, where
you can find monsters "out-of-depth" (ood), meaning that you will encounter way
more powerful enemies than would usually occur on a particular depth.
That can be very dangerous but also very rewarding. Out-of-depth monsters
sometimes occur inside of so-called "pits" and very likely inside "vaults".

Pits are large rooms, surrounded by a rectangle-shaped passage, containing
monsters picked by a pit-specific criterium (troll pit, zoo pit...).

Usually pits are very welcome means for gaining experience or items, like orc
pits at low character levels, troll pits at low-medium character levels,
dragon pits at high character levels and to an extent greater demon pits.

Some pits have a rather bad threat/reward ratio though, such as treasure pits
(containing jellies, molds and mimics that look like treasure, not actually
real treasure), humanoid pits, undead pits (called 'graveyards' - the problem
is that they contain a lot of wall-eaters, which is hard to handle sometimes),
zoos (animal pits, that often contain multiple nasty quylthulgs) and chapels
(lesser angels, but also knight templars which may summon more dangerous angels
if unlucky).
Kennels (canines and hounds) are usually safe, but at higher level you should
watch out for aether hounds and gravity hounds which may breathe gravity for
tele-to effect.
Many rather mid-level demon pits may contain wall-eating lesser balrogs, but
with some effort can be cleared without much hassle, especially if you have
wraithform at your disposal.

Vaults are (sometimes extremely large) fixed structures of rooms and passages,
mostly surrounded by permanent walls that cannot be damaged except for a few
entrance spots made of normal granite wall. However, some vaults are open and
do not require special effort to get into, or are not even surrounded by
permanent walls.
They are usually filled to the brim with traps and nasty monsters. Using means
of trap detection and monster sensing allows you to spot vaults easily, if its
wall structure or permanent walls (not all vaults have those) doesn't already
give it away.
Another very early indication for a vault on your dungeon level are the floor
feelings displayed in yellow colour, see (4.8).

A vault can be a real adventure of its own! If your character isn't very
powerful compared to the dungeon level, you better stay out of vaults if their
structure doesn't allow easy monster killing.
Note that some monsters can destroy walls and thereby dig their way out of a
vault, if they are awake. So in case of dangerous vaults you better stay at a
distance or even leave the level.

Besides pits and vaults, there are also special rooms with features inside,
see 'Pit', 'Vault' or 'Room' in (0.4).



(4.7) Traps & trap kits
-----------------------

About traps:
------------
At the beginning you will encounter traps that can do little damage, some will
decrease your stats temporarily, they are annoying but not a big danger.
However, later on traps will become extremely nasty and you should either get
a very high searching skill or make sure that you have staves, spells or
scrolls that can detect traps. If you encounter a dangerous trap do not try to
disarm it if you are not very sure that you can do it without setting it off,
or if you don't at least know that setting it off won't have too bad effects
(some traps aren't very harmful, so you can just keep trying to disarm them).

If you manually disarm a trap (ie via the disarm command instead of relying on
magic spells or magic devices that do the disarming for you) you will get a
certain amount of experience points depending on the trap type; it can pay off
to disarm a large patch of traps.

Disarming traps will become an essential part of the gameplay later on. Vaults
will have *lots* of traps and if you haven't got superior disarming skills (or
wands of disarming / trap destruction) every single move of your character will
have to be planned! This can be especially annoying and dangerous if there are
multiplying or extremely tough monsters inside the vault. If your searching
ability is 'Heroic' or 'Legendary' you will discover most traps instantly just
by coming close to them without having to explicitely search for them.
If you look at an object that is on an already detected trap, you will be
notified about the trap by an ^ symbol in front of the item name and the trap
type appended to it in { } brackets. It looks like this:
^ A potion of Constitution {Chaos Ball Trap}

Trap symbols ('^') come in different colours. Here's an overview:
    blue            stat traps (STR/INT/WIS/DEX/CON/CHR) in three difficulties:
                    1) only reduces an attribute temporarily, heals on its own.
                    2) reduces an attribute, requiring you to use restoration.
                    3) permanently reduces an attribute. Counter with stat
                       potion.
    bright white    teleport traps
    orange          dungeon/trap rearrangment traps
    violet          summoning traps
    yellow          item-affecting traps
    red             character status-affecting traps
    green           elemental bolt traps
    light blue      elemental ball traps
    light red       arrow/bolt/dagger traps
    white           miscellaneous traps


About trap kits:
----------------
The 'Trapping' skill allows a player to set up 'monster traps'.
The ability to set up a trap can be accessed by pressing the 'm' key
or by utilizing the macro wizard (press % and z to start it).

A monster trap consists of
-a trap kit
-an item (or a stack of items) to load the trap kit.

Each kind of trap kit requires different items serving as ammunition:
Catapult Trap Kit       -       Sling ammo (fires with 2x base might).
 (orange)
Arrow Trap Kit          -       Arrows (fires with 3x base might).
 (red)
Bolt Trap Kit           -       Bolts (fires with 4x base might).
 (bright red)
Fumes Trap Kit          -       Potions. The effects are very similar to the
 (dark blue)                    effects when throwing a potion at a monster,
                                the trap will greatly increase the potion's
                                effectiveness though, by generating a thick
                                fume that envelops nearby creatues and
                                possibly gets inhaled as well.
Magic Trap Kit          -       Scrolls or runes. Even scrolls that are usually
 (violet)                       only used on other items might have effects on
                                certain creatures.
Device Trap Kit         -       Wands/Staves/Rods.
 (slate)                        The charges of wands and staves will be
                                decreased by 1 each time the trap sets off.
                                Rod-traps will have timeouts, same as the rod
                                itself.

A normal trap kit can be loaded with 1 item of the according ammo.
After it went off (and is out of charges for device traps) you can pick up the
trap kit to use it again.
If it was a catapult/arrow/bolt trap kit you can often recover the ammunition
too, in case it didn't break. (Magic ammo and artifact ammo never break).

Trap kits can have special (ego) powers:
(prefixes:)
Automatic       - Can set off up to 99 times, with a 20% chance each time of
                  ceasing to function. Requires the according amount of ammo
                  though, if it's not a device trap kit.
Fully Automatic - Sets off up to 99 times.
                  Requires the according amount of ammunition if it's not a
                  device trap kit.
Well-hidden     - Makes it harder for monsters to spot the trap.
Complicated     - Trap gets an extra AC bonus, making it harder to disarm.
Obvious         - Curses the trap and makes it practically useless.

(suffixes:)
of Extra Might  - fires with +x (bonus shown in round brackets) extra might.
                  ("It fires missiles with extra might.")
of Extra Shots  - fires +x (bonus shown in round brackets) extra shots/round.
                  ("It fires missiles excessively fast.")
for Dragons     - Only triggers against dragons. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots.
for Demons      - Only triggers against demons. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots.
for Animals     - Only triggers against animals. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots.
for Undead      - Only triggers against undead. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots. May damage or destroy ghosts.
for Evil        - Only triggers against evil. Especially hard to spot.
                  Fires extra shots. May damage or destroy ghosts.

Trap kits can also have two special properties in addition to the above:
Kill Ghosts     - trap kit will also harm creatures in wraithform (those are
                  all creatures that can pass solid walls). Trap kits without
                  KILL_GHOST flag cannot hurt wraithform creatures.

Teleport-To     - after triggering, if the monster is still alive, it will be
                  teleported to the player (TELEPORT_TO).

If monsters notice a trap they can try to disarm it:

A pval (that's a number in round parentheses, eg (+2)) increases the trap's
"stealth", making it well-hidden and therefore harder for monsters to notice.

The "armour class" bonus of a trap kit, given in brackets (eg [+8]) increases
the trap's complexity, making it harder for monsters to disarm the trap.

Trap kits and ammo that were disarmed by a monster cannot be recovered.

You can disarm your own traps to get back the trap kit (and ammunition).


Hints for quick and easy handling:
----------------------------------
It is a good idea to inscribe trap kits and their loads.
For example you could inscribe all trapping-related items  !=  so you will pick
them up from the floor automatically when you want to retrieve trap kits that
went off.

Also you could inscribe the ammo/load items  @m1  so you can macro them easily.

In the macro wizard you could even make a macro that prompts you for which trap
kit to use if you enter a blank line (just hit ENTER key) when it asks you
which item you want to load a trap with.

Last but not least when your trapper is low level and you pick up all sorts of
bad potions you could make a macro to load a fumes trap kit with a potion
inscribed  @m1 . Now make another macro that lets you inscribe all the bad
potions you pick up  @m1  so you won't have to do that manually for each of
them. That inscribing-macro could look like this:
{-@m1\r
where the '-' will cause the { inscribe command to prompt for inscription first
and the item afterwards, effectively simply asking you to specify the item.



(4.8) Dungeon, floor & vault feelings
-------------------------------------
Dungeon feelings:
-----------------
Dungeons that haven't been visited for a while will start giving a temporary
experience bonus, until the game perceives them as 'well explored' again.
If you enter such a rarely visited dungeon you will be notified about the
experience bonus by one of these dungeon feelings, displayed in light umber:

  "This place has not been explored recently.":        +7% experience gain.

  "This place has not been explored in a long time.":  +13% experience gain.

  "This place has not been explored in ages.":         +20% experience gain.

These boni stack with boni from 'bad' (orange) floor feelings explained below.


Floor feelings:
---------------
Sometimes if you enter a new dungeon level your character will have a special
feeling about it, called 'level feelings' or 'floor feelings', displayed in
orange text.
These feelings are as follows:

  "You feel an imminent danger!" ->     This dungeon level is *way* higher
                                        than your character level.
                                        (Does not show in the IDDC.)

  "You feel a suppressive air." ->      You cannot use wraith form or
                                        probability travel on this level.
                                        (NO_MAGIC, +10% experience bonus!)

  "The air seems distorted." ->         You cannot use genocide on this level!
  (formerly 'feeling of peace')         (NO_GENO, +5% experience bonus!)

  "You lose all sense of direction..." -> You won't be able to auto-map this
                                        dungeon, meaning that you won't
                                        remember the dungeon layout.
                                        You can only see your nearby
                                        surroundings within your character's
                                        line of sight.
                                        (NO_MAP, +15% experience bonus!)

  "You feel like a stranger..." ->      You cannot use magic mapping nor
                                        clairvoyance here!
                                        (NO_MAGIC_MAP, +10% experience bonus!)

  "The walls here seem very solid." ->  The dungeon structure on this level
                                        is unaffected by *Destruction* or by
                                        earthquake magic.
                                        (NO_DESTROY, +5% experience bonus!)

  "You feel that your life hangs in the balance!" ->    ** Extremely dangerous
                                        to normal/everlasting players! **
                                        This only occurs on a level where
                                        Morgoth, Lord of Darkness resides,
                                        grasping the area with his untamable
                                        will to destroy.
                                        Players who die on this level will be
                                        completely extinguished and not even
                                        their ghost will survive! Everlasting
                                        and normal players will die the same
                                        way as unworldly and hellish ones!

  "You don't sense a magic barrier here..." ->   This message only occurs in
                                        Ironman or no-recall dungeons/towers.
                                        It lets you know that you may use
                                        Word of Recall on this floor!
                                        (This message is displayed in green
                                        colour, not orange.)

In addition to those orange level specialties, there are more feelings you
may get about the danger a level poses. Those only appear if you spent some
time (usually a few minutes) on the dungeon level you were coming from, so
they won't be helpful while stair-scumming or probability-travelling quickly.
(Exception: On Ironman-rule servers these will always be displayed, since all
dungeons are ironman and stair-scumming is not possible.)
The number telling you the current floor's depth (or a town name if you're in a
town) in the bottom right corner of the main window will get a light blue star
appended to it when you spent enough time on your current floor to receive an
extra feeling on entering the next floor. If you are in a town, the town's name
will turn light blue instead of a star appearing.
These extra level feelings (displayed in yellow) are:

  "What a terrifying place.."
      means a) there's a highly ood monster (20..40 levels above floor level,
      with 40 actually being the maximum possible ood level shift, compare
      ood explanation in (0.4)) or
      b) a great vault and some ood monster (10..19 levels) on the level.
      If you receive this message it will in most cases also change the normal
      music theme of that dungeon to a special 'terrifying' music, making it
      easier to notice quickly.

  "You sense an air of danger.."
      means there's a freely roaming ood monster (10..19 levels)
      on the level, and also the level has a vault on it somewhere.

  "Feels somewhat dangerous around here.."
      means there's a vault or a rather dangerous monster pit or nest
      on the level.

  "There's a sensation of challenge.."
      means there's a freely roaming slightly ood monster (10..19 levels)
      on the level.

  "There's a special feeling about this place.."
      means there's a unique monster on the level.
      (Dungeon bosses cause this feeling too, just like any unique monster.)

  "What a boring place.."
      means nothing of the above apply to this level.

Explanations:
"Freely roaming" means that the monster isn't generated inside a vault.
"Ood" means out of depth, ie a monster which is of higher level than the actual
dungeon level it spawned on.

Note that you will only get one, ie the strongest of these feelings applying
to your dungeon level, meaning feelings higher up the list will take precedence
over those below.

Also, the feeling of a dungeon level only indicate its status at the very
moment of the level being created initially!

This means the feeling will persist, even if its cause is removed or changed.
For example if the feeling indicates an OOD monster and you kill it,
you or following players entering that floor will still get that same feeling.
Or if a powerful monster spawns later on on an initially "boring place" level,
it'll remain to feel like a boring place, despite the new monster that might
actually make it pretty non-boring now..


You can check the floor feeling again anytime with the '/feel' command. If you
weren't eligible for receiving a floor feeling (because you didn't spend enough
time on the previous floor) then this command will just tell you:
  "You feel nothing special.".


If you are in the Ironman Deep Dive Challenge dungeon, you will get a feeling
informing you about the presence of a dungeon boss monster that belongs to the
dungeon theme in your current IDDC section.
This feeling appears in addition to the yellow floor feelings listed above:

  "You feel a commanding presence.."
      means that the dungeon boss of the current IDDC theme has been spawned.


Vault feelings:
---------------
Vaults can also bear a very dangerous feature that is displayed as dark grey
feeling as soon as you are about to enter the vault:

  "The air in here feels very still." ->  Means that you cannot use any type of
                                        teleportation, including Word of Recall
                                        while inside the vault. Beware!
                                        Further, Wraith Form and probability
                                        travel won't work either!
                                        The fact that you are standing within
                                        a no-tele area is also indicated by
                                        your (xx, yy) position display on the
                                        lower left area of the main window and
                                        also your speed indicator on the bottom
                                        status line of the main window
                                        turning from light green to dark grey!
                                        Also, the music will in most cases
                                        change from the normal theme of that
                                        dungeon to the same music played on
                                        'terrifying' levels, for easier notice.

As soon as you leave such a no-teleport-vault you'll receive this feeling:
  "Fresh air greets you as you leave the vault."



(4.9) Navigating on maps
------------------------
The world map is divided into 64 x 64 world map sectors. Each of these sectors
contains 5 x 5 smaller subsectors (screens). Dungeon levels or tower floors
also can have up to 5 x 5 subsectors, same as 1 world map sector. (Use 'L' key
to look around your current worldmap sector/dungeon level, and you will see
the subsector coordinates displayed at the top line.)
Monsters cannot cross world map sector borders! Keep this in mind while
travelling, it might save your life.

Note that dungeon/tower levels are often smaller than 5 x 5 subsectors,
sometimes even just as small as 2 x 2.
While you are looking around with 'L' key, the current map sector is displayed
in the top left corner of the screen. This information can help other players
to find you in case you need help!

You can press 'M' to invoke a map that gives you a larger overview.
If you press 'M' in a dungeon, tower or a town, you'll see the complete 4 x 4
sectors. If you invoke the map while you're in the wilderness outside of towns,
you will see a part of the 64 x 64 world map, centered around your current
world map sector, displaying towns (yellow T), the sea (blue %), mountains (^)
and other information (compare (4.4)).
If you want to see the world map while in town or in a dungeon, press ~ key and
choose "Wilderness map".

In the main window around the very bottom left corner you will see two numbers
separated by a komma, these tell you your current world map sector.
In case you're currently in a town, the town's name will be displayed in the
bottom right corner of the screen.
(You can also see your coordinates by invoking the character screen with 'C'.)

If you're in a dungeon or tower, you will see your current depth/height in
feet. Each dungeon level or tower floor has a height of 50 feet.
Example: If it shows '-550ft' that means you've descended to the 11th level
of the dungeon. The deeper you go, the more nasty monsters will show up.
Negative depths in dungeons and positive heights in towers mean identical
monster difficulties. Example: In Bree there's a tower and a dungeon. In the
2nd tower floor on 100ft you will usually find the same monsters as in the
dungeon on level -100ft (2nd dungeon level).



(4.10) Houses
-------------
There are two types of houses, private houses and (very few) public houses.
Public houses have walls of slate colour, while private houses have white
walls. Public houses always have a light brown house door and can be entered
by anyone, they cannot be bought.

Private houses can actually be bought by a player, and their access can be
configured for example to allow everyone in your party to enter it.
Press 'h' to buy or sell a private house, or to change house parameters (for
example giving all your party members access to it). You need to stand directly
next to the house door to do this.
If you sell a house you get half the money back it cost you to buy it, or
actually even a bit less than half, depending on your charisma.
(When that house is sold, all items that are still inside are erased.)

The door colour of private houses will indicate the door permissions,
ie which players may access it:

-a light brown house door indicates that the house is currently unowned
 (so you can buy it if you have sufficient funds).

-a light green house door indicates that you are the owner.

-a dark green house door indicates that another character of yours is the owner
 which means that you are allowed to enter it too (provided your character is
 not of incompatible mode).

-a grey door indicates that this house is already owned by someone and you
 don't have access to it.

-a light blue door indicates that you may access this house because it's set
 to party access for your party.

-a violet door indicates that you may access this house because you're in the
 same guild as the owner, ie the house is set to 'guild access'.
 (Note: Guild access is currently disabled.)

-a yellow door indicates that you will have access to this house, as soon as
 your level matches the level restriction set by its owner.

Houses with party access allow further restrictions. Those are:

-a white door indicates that the door has a race and/or class restriction,
 and you may access it because you match the race/class of the owner.
-an orange door indicates that you don't match a race/class restriction.

-a light red door indicates that access is restricted to either winners
 (Kings/Queens/Emperors/Empresses) or to fallen winners (winners who died and
 thus lost their title), and you may access it because you match the condition.
-a red door means that you fail to match above restriction.
(Note: The restrictions 'winners' and 'fallen winners' can be applied together
when setting house door restrictions. In that case, they will require anyone
who wants to enter to be either winner or fallen winner.)

-a dark grey door means that this house may only be accessed by no-ghost
 characters, that means either unworldly or hellish.

If you forgot which houses you own, type ~9 or use the /houses command to see a
list of your houses.
The house owner can always access his house and cannot lock himself out by
setting restrictions. The door will always be displayed light green to him.

Note: The colour of house walls and doors are affected by day/night, so in the
night the colours will not be accurate but darker, until you come close enough
that the door is within your lamp's light radius.

Special gimmick: You can press 'h' or use the /paint command to paint your
house, see the "/paint" command in (0.2b) for more information.

WARNING:
Items on the floor within a house don't form piles! If you drop too many
items and space in the house runs out the dropped item may just disappear!


(4.10a) Player stores
---------------------
Players can turn their houses into stores, which run automagically even while
they aren't logged on. Other players can enter your store and buy items, but
not sell any. You will receive cheques that you can turn in for money by simply
reading them with 'r' key, same as scrolls. You can also 'I'nspect them.
The prices customers will see listed when they enter your store are at least as
high as twice of the item's base value (or in other words half of normal Black
Market price, except that prices in player stores do not depend on race or
charisma). You can further increase an item's price by inscribing it, if
you like:

To turn a house into a player-store, simply put an item in it that carries the
  @S
inscription. This inscription means that this item will be put up for sale in
your store for the item's default price.
(Press '{' key to inscribe an item or '}' key to remove an inscription.)
As soon as a house contains at least one item inscribed this way, if a player
who does not have access to the house tries to open the door, he will be
presented with a store screen where he can buy those inscribed items.

The default price of an item is 2x its base value that it would cost in normal
(non black market) town stores. This price cannot be undercut in player shops.
However, the following items have a default price of only 1x their base value:
- Rings of Speed
- Scrolls of Artifact Creation
- Random artifacts

If you want to set a higher price than the default price, you can inscribe the
item with the price like this:
  @S20000
This will ask for 20000 gold, provided the minimum price isn't actually higher.

Instead of setting a price, you can also add to the base price, by using the
following inscription syntax:
  @S+10000
This will add 10000 gold to the default price that is asked for.

Another way of increasing the price is by multiplying it with a percentage,
which may range from 100 to 1000 depending on the server,
like this:
  @S%150
This will sell the item for 1.5 times (150%) the default price.

Note that if you want to put up items with inscriptions longer than just the
store-part, you need to terminate the store inscription with a dot or space.
Examples:
  Hello@S10000.Customer
  @S Good stuff
This item will appear in your store with an inscription "HelloCustomer". The
"S@..." part is always omitted. This way, you can add short notes to the items
you offer.

You can use 'k' and 'M' to denote a multiplier of thousand and million
respectively:
  @S3k  will sell for 3000,
  @S1M  will sell for 1000000.

If you want to display items that are not for sale, eg create a 'museum', you
can inscribe the items
  @S-
which will make them unsellable, yet they will be on display on your store.

You can also put up 'signs' in your store by inscribing a (non-massive)
piece of wood "@S:" followed by the desired sign text. Signs are just for
viewing and cannot be purchased by customers. For example inscribe it:
  @S:Welcome to my store!
Items in stores are sorted by their type. Inscribed store signs however are not
sorted, and other items that are sorted in will pass them by when checking
where they are to be sorted in. This allows you to rearrange the store signs at
will, but might need some experimenting and shuffling around all other items
till you achieve the desired result.

If another player buys your item, there will be a 10% fee that is cut from your
profits.
The rest of the price the customer paid will be imprinted into a cheque. This
cheque is then placed into an available spot in that house. To turn a cheque
into money, simply press 'r' to read it like you would read a scroll.
You can also 'I'nspect a cheque to find out how much it's worth.

There are two types of cheques:
Normally, if an item or a whole pile is bought by someone, the item or pile
will simply be replaced with a cheque accordingly, for you to withdraw.
If however the customer buys only part of a pile of items, then another type
of cheque will be used, called 'mass cheque' which uses one extra slot in your
house and combines all sales of partial piles of items.
While normal cheques are inscribed with details of the item that was sold, mass
cheques only say 'various piled items' or something similar.
So if you offer piles, make sure that you have at least one free space in your
house, or the cheque cannot be generated! In that case the purchase will be
cancelled and the customer will see a message:
"Sorry, the store is currently not open for sale. Please contact .. the owner!"

Usually, player stores may only pop up if a player doesn't have access to that
house door. If you want to test your own player store though, you can just
press 'h' key or use the /pstore command when standing next to your house door
(see (0.2b)).

To indicate that your house is a player store, you can use 'h' key or the
"/paint" command to paint your house entrance for other players to see!
Please see (0.2b) for more information about painting.



(4.11)  Malicious effects players can suffer
--------------------------------------------
The player can suffer from various effects caused by monsters, traps or
himself. Against several of these effects the 'Saving Throw' ability helps
to decide whether it will be resisted or not (especially true for effects
that are cast by monsters on the player - see (6.3) for more details on
Saving Throw).
The various effects are:

For 'Fear', 'Blindness', 'Confusion' and 'Paralysis' - please see (5.6).

Hunger  -Gorged         Your speed gets reduced by 10.
        -Full           While being /afk in 'Full' state or in normal state
                        (normal = no food state is displayed, the 'Full'
                        disappeared), your digestion will be stopped, allowing
                        you to remain afk as long as you wish.
        -Hungry
        -Weak (yellow)
        -Weak (orange)
        -Weak (red)     You lose hit points and get paralyzed even with FA.
         (starving)     If you hit a bowel cramps trap, you instantly enter
                        this nutrition state. 'Slow Digestion' will help to
                        not get insta-paralyzed!
        You will regenerate hit points slower if you are weak, and not at
        all if you are starving (red 'Weak').

Slowdown        Monsters can cast spells or breathe (inertia, gravity) to slow
                the player down. This effect is temporary. 'Free Action' helps
                a bit to reduce the effect from inertia breath.

Stun    -Stun           Reduces to-hit and to-dam.
                        Reduces your martial arts damage (because you cannot
                        perform MA special styles while stunned).
                        Reduces chance for successful spell-casting.
                        Prevents you from intercepting a monster (see (6.2)
                        'Interception' skill).
                        Reduces chance to block or parry.
        -Heavy stun     Greatly reduces to-hit and to-dam.
                        Reduces your martial arts damage (because you cannot
                        perform MA special styles while stunned).
                        Greatly reduces chance for successful spell-casting.
        -Knocked out    You cannot perform any action while knocked out,
                        it leaves your character completely helpless.
                        Beware!

                        High AC helps to avoid melee-based stuns (see (5.12))
                        (most famous monster is probably "The Stormbringer"),
                        while stun from sound attacks can only be prevented
                        by having sound resistance.

                        Melee-based stun can be caused by HIT, PUNCH, KICK,
                        BUTT and CRUSH type attacks, also see (*) below.

Cut                     Cuts will make you lose HP continuously.
(Graze, Light cut, Bad cut, Nasty cut, Severe cut, Deep gash, Mortal wound)
                        Cuts can be caused by melee based critical monster hits
                        that use HIT, CLAW or BITE attack type (also see (*)
                        below), or by shard attacks.
                        By transforming into a monster that has NO_CUT flag
                        (mostly undead forms), the player becomes immune to
                        cut effects.
                        Cuts from shards can be avoided with shard resistance.

Poison  -Poisoned       The player will continuously lose Hit Points.
                        Resisting poison will prevent the player from getting
                        poisoned (compare (5.6)).

Not really a status effect but..
Switch places           Monsters that have MOVE_BODY flag may switch place with
                        the player. This can be very dangerous if it happens in
                        a situation where the player is standing on a staircase
                        on purpose to retreat quickly if the situation gets out
                        of hands and the player is also within a no-teleport
                        area.
                        The higher the player's level and the greater his body
                        weight is, the less likely he is going to get switched.

(*) Details about melee-induced cuts and stuns:
For a monster attack to cause cuts or stun it must deal at least 95% of its
potential damage maximum (rounded down). This is also called a 'critical hit'
of a monster (has nothing to do with the critical-hit mechanics for player
attacks).

An attack type ('HIT') that can do both, cut and stun, will randomly do either
one, but never both at once. The 95% damage criterium is measured for the final
damage ie after the damage-reduction of AC has been applied. This is why high
armour class helps *alot* to prevent any type of cut or stun effect that comes
from critical hits by monsters, no matter how high the actual potential damage
of that attack might be.
However, unlike the most common damage types (like 'HURT') certain damage types
cannot be mitigated by AC and hence their cut/stun potential is always to be
reckoned with (see damage types in the second table in (5.12a), which say so if
they can be mitigated by AC.)

Example:
A Star-Spawn of Cthulhu hits you with its 2d33 CRUSH attack. The attack could
deal 2..66 damage. This means its potential maximum damage is 66 (if both dice
rolls turn out a 33 each). 95% of 66 is 62 (rounded down from 62.7), so if that
hit deals a final damage of 62 or higher, you will get stunned. Note that this
attack of the Star-Spawn doesn't have a HURT effect but instead an UN_BONUS
effect. UN_BONUS attacks do not get their damage reduced by AC, so a Star-Spawn
always has a chance to stun you, even if your AC is very high.


(4.11a) Drain effects
---------------------
Apart from the effects listed above which are indicated in the status bar at
the bottom of the main window, there are three 'drain' effects that can occur.
These can be caused by items, monsters or terrain, and are:

Experience drain ('Drains your life force')
    Having 'Hold Life' does not protect against this.
    If you equip multiple items that drain experience, the total drain will
    diminish with each further item though instead of adding up, so for example
    using two rings of power will be less severe than than one might expect.
    If experience drain hits the threshold for your current character level, it
    will not drain any further, so you cannot lose a level from it. Beware
    however, that you are not hit by another life draining effect that lowers
    your experience further below the level threshold, or the experience drain
    will kick in again.
    Experience drain is on hold while you are in town areas, this includes
    dungeon towns.
    All the rings of power that are dropped by Nazgul drain experience (and
    turn you invisible).

Mana drain ('Drains your magic')
    Drains your mana pool over time while you have this item equipped.

Hit point drain ('Drains your hit points')
    Drains your hit points down to zero, then stops. This means that this
    effect won't kill you, but can make it extremely risky to go AFK in an
    unsafe place. Well, going AFK in an unsafe place can kill you anyway.

    HP drain stacks and is given by:
     -Items that just drain your HP
     -Items that have strong good powers and you use them as a Vampire
     -The sun, when it's day and you're a Vampire and out in the open without
      a protective mummy wrapping
     -Monster forms that provide wall-passing (wraith form)

    HP drain can be countered by HP regeneration, which can be gained from:
     -'Regeneration' ability (which is a flag, ie one source providing it is
      enough and having more than one regen source won't increase the effect),
      gained from items or as racial/form bonus
     -Health skill
     -Holy Curing school bonus
     -Nature school spell
     -Biofeedback from fire stones
    which all stack too.

Also see (5.17) for how these drain effects stack or may be cancelled out.



(4.12)  Malicious effects monsters can suffer
---------------------------------------------
Monsters can be affected by similar effects as players.
Those are:

Fear, blindness, confusion, sleep, slowing, and stun.

Note (except for 'stun' effect):
      There are basic spells or magic devices that don't do anything except
      trying to cause one of these effects directly, for example a 'wand of
      slow monsters' or the spell 'scare'.
      It is important to know that unique monsters are always unaffected by
      these basic spells. Other monsters have a chance to resist, depending on
      their level vs the power (level) of the spell.

Effect details:
---------------
Fear is a temporary effect, causing the monster to flee. Many monsters turn
        afraid if their hit points drop very low. Wears off after a while.
        Monsters that have NO_FEAR flag cannot be scared.
Blindness and confusion are currently the same thing, resulting in erratic
        movements and being unable to cast spells or attack. Usually only
        low level monsters are prone to these.
        They are temporary effects that wear off after a while.
        Monsters that have NO_CONF flag cannot be confused.
        Undead, demon, dragons, nonliving monsters and monsters of level 45 or
        higher cannot be blinded.
Sleep is especially nice if it's cast as an area effect. Gets you out of
        trouble, although most higher monsters are immune to it.
        Monsters will wake up after a while, depending on your stealth.
        Sleep effects are NOT cumulative.
        Monsters that have NO_SLEEP flag cannot be slept. Note that they may
        still be asleep when you meet them though.
Slowing on monsters is currently a permanent effect. Very effective, although
        many higher monsters are immune to it. Also, it is currently
        cumulative (subject to change) and can be applied several times,
        although monsters might resist.
Stun    (Note that "stunned" and "dazed" are the same thing.)
        Stun can be caused by special martial art attacks among other things.
        Stunned monsters have a harder time to successfully cast spells or hit
        you in melee combat. Also monsters cannot interfere with your actions
        while they are stunned. Many monsters are immune to stun, but also
        many monsters - even of high level - are not.
        Monsters can also be heavily stunned or knocked out, same as players.
        Stun is temporary and will wear off, if no new stun effect is applied.
        Monsters that have NO_STUN flag cannot be stunned.

Monsters have a saving throw, and unique monsters are usually immune to some
of these crowd-control effects.



(4.13) Extermination Orders, Events and Ironman Challenge
---------------------------------------------------------
Your character will have uncounted opportunities to receive and carry out
extermination orders and participate in global (as in, open to everyone at the
same time) events.
Extermination orders can be received by a player on demand and only concern him
personally, while events are automatically scheduled in regular time intervals
and allow (or even require) multiple players to participate simultaneously.

Some events will require you to have zero experience in order to participate.
The maximum experience your character ever accumulated counts for this, so
make sure you don't gain even 1 point of experience before the event starts!
The following actions may reward 1 XP without you noticing:
  -Eating a bad food ration.
  -Picking a lock.
  -Transferring items or money from another player to you.
  -Picking up/earning more than 300 gold pieces (IDDC-exclusive characters are
   unable to pick up any gold at all, and in turn start out with 300 extra).
   Use the /ex command to see how much more gold you may pick up
Killing townspeople in Bree however will not give you any experience.
Stay clean!


Here is a list of currently available events:

Extermination Orders
--------------------
These are basically 'kill quests'. You need to venture out and kill a fixed
amount of a certain type of monster.
To receive an order, visit the major in the town hall (one of the '+'
doors in town), or if you are in the IDDC simply type "/xorder" in the chat.
There is a certain time limit which in most cases is easily sufficient,
especially if you have the according ESP ability.
The time limit is actually two 'in-game days', which in real time lasts
somewhat over two hours. (See (4.14) for more information about the
in-game time system.)
The time will continue to run out even while you're not logged on.
If you carry out the extermination order you received, you will be rewarded
with a good or great item, depending on the difficulty (monster level) and
chance.
The item does not depend on your race, class, skills or luck in any way,
it's completely random. It's quality is also on average lower than the items
obtained from winning events (read further below about events).
If you fail to carry out your order in time, the order will be cancelled and
you can just get a new one if you want to. There is no penalty.

Party members (and you) can see that you received an extermination order by
looking at the character list ('@' key): An 'X' will appear behind your
location information (except if they are using the super compact @-screen
layout that shows only two lines per player).

On an Ironman server or within the Ironman Deep Dive Challenge dungeon, the
amount of monsters that need to be slain is somewhat lower (especially for low
level orders). Also, in the IDDC and in the Halls of Mandos, the monster level
of the extermination order will depend on the floor level rather than on the
player's level.


Events (use /evinfo and /evsign commands to get information and to sign up)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Item rewards depend on your character, see (8.5) for more information
      about item rewards.

Make sure that you aren't inside a dungeon that does not allow normal usage of
Word of Recall when an event begins that you signed up for, or you will fail to
join the event! (Eg ironman, forcedown, no-recall dungeons, even if you're on
the final floor and could use Word of Recall.)

Highlander Tournament (pvp, only one can win, 2+ participants)
    When you see a message, announcing a Highlander Tournament, type "/evinfo"
    in the chat to find out more, and use "/evsign" followed by the event's
    number to sign up for participation.
    It's a deathmatch with 10 minutes of preparation time, and only newly
    created characters with 0 experience may join it.
    The winner will receive a deed that can be 'r'ead, and turned in at Bree's
    Mayor Office for either an item that fits the needs of the character (it
    checks which skills you have trained to determine the item), or the deed
    can be turned in for a temporary luck boost. Usually you will want the
    item. However, you can trade the deed to someone else, who can then go and
    redeem it for luck for that character of his (although the luck bonus he
    gets will be somewhat lower than what the original owner would receive).
    All losers will also receive a deed on the next character they log in with
    which can be turned in for a small temporary luck bonus.
    For details about luck see LUCK flag in (5.8).

    Detailed course of the event:

    After signing up, players can kill townies for cash and go shopping.
    They must not earn ANY experience though, or they won't be able to
    participate when the event starts.
    If a player collects more than 300 gold, he will gain 1 experience point,
    and therefore become uneligible to participate.
    Picking up items belonging to other players will also give 1 experience.

    When the event starts, all players are teleported into a specific dungeon
    that is reserved for Highlander Tournament participants exclusively.
    All players receive an Amulet of the Highlands which they should not forget
    to wear, because it gives the character considerable power.
    They now have 10 minutes to level up in this dungeon.
    In this highlander dungeon players are randomly teleported when they take a
    staircase, so even if two players take the same staircase they won't end up
    next to each other.

    After 10 minutes, everyone is teleported out of the dungeon and meets on a
    battlefield where they have to kill each other, because it is well known
    that THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!

    When a player is slain and drops his items, other players can pick up his
    Amulet of the Highlands and 'w'ear it, which will make it fuse with an
    already existing Amulet of the Highlands, increasing its power!

    When only one player is left, he will be the designated winner, and
    teleported back to Bree. He automatically receives a victory deed in his
    inventory which he can exchange at the Mayor's office in the town hall.
    It can be exchanged for eiter an item or a temporary luck bonus.
    He can also give this deed to another character if he wishes, although in
    that case it can only be exchanged for a luck bonus, not an item, and the
    bonus will be somewhat lower than for the Highlander champion himself.

    All losers will also receive a 'contenders deed' on the next character they
    log on with, which can be exchanged at the Mayor's office for small
    temporary luck bonus (note that it vanishes when you log off).

    A note regarding turning in a deed for an item:
    The item you get will be random but still depend on your character's skill
    points spent. So you should not turn in the deed before you actually spent
    your skill points. For example if you spend several points into
    Sword-mastery then _if_ you receive a weapon it will actually be a sword.
    See (8.5) for details!
    Highlander Tournament rewards can theoretically end up with a higher item
    value in gold than rewards from other events. Reward items cannot be sold
    to stores though.

Arena Monster Challenge (no losses or gains, for testing your abilities)
    The wizards of Arena Monster Challenge (tm) have prepared a spectacular
    event on the top floor of Bree's training tower, which will allow any Joe
    and Jane to experience top-notch fights against creatures that usually
    pose lethal threat. In this illusonary arena, players will experience
    a fight that seems absolutely real, but they won't suffer any
    consequences if they lose, ie 'die'. Test your might against any foe you
    always wanted to challenge but never dared in real dungeoneer's life!
    It's also possible to challenge ego monsters (such as veteran archers or
    holy animals). The arena corners are safe zones and allow for spectating.
    Note that you cannot die or suffer various hazardous effects in the arena,
    and monsters cannot summon. Hint: If you want to spice a monster up, try
    the /scream command while it's in your line of sight.
    Inventory and equipment cannot be damaged/destroyed or disenchanted in this
    event, and you cannot get disarmed either.

Dungeon Keeper (everyone can win, 1+ participants)
    (You should enable 'easy_open' option in  = 6  for this event, which is
    enabled by default, and lets you open doors simply be moving into them.)

    Characters who want to participate must not be of higher level than 14.
    A character can participate only once in this event.
    PvP-mode characters are not eligible to join.
    Running, phasing, teleporting, magic mappping, detection and ESP are
    disabled in the event. Also, your speed cannot exceed +0 (Normal), and
    the lava that floods the dungeon will deal irresistible damage even if
    your character is immune to fire.
    Except for a brass lantern which you can buy from town
    store '1' (general store), no items are required for this event.

    When the event starts, all participants are transported into a labyrinth of
    rooms made of impenetrable walls but connected by doors or even void jump
    gates.
    The goal is to find one of four escape beacon, which is a light green '>'.
    Everyone who steps on an escape beacon and presses the '>' key will be
    teleported to Bree and has thereby successfully escaped the maze and
    qualified as a winner.

    It does not matter who the first or last is to leave, everyone who manages
    to get out, wins, and gets a parchment for reward that can be turned in at
    the mayor's office.
    After about 5 minutes, the dungeon floor however will crackle, and be
    flooded more and more with lava. Time is running out. Now the players who
    haven't escaped yet should hurry, before the maze is completely submerged
    in lava. Doors and the exit beacons will stay clear until the very final
    push of lava occurs which then completely submerges everything.
    However, it seems the former keeper of this abandoned maze left behind a
    horrible guardian, the Horned Reaper. It can sense your presence and if it
    manages to catch you, there is no hope of survival.

    Players who do not manage to escape, but die, still get a small reward. It
    is again a parchment that can be turned in at the mayor's office. The next
    character a player logs on with after losing in the event will receive it.

    Winner parchments can be turned in for either an item or a temporary luck
    buff (about 30 minutes duration). The item will depend on how you have
    spent your skill points, so make sure to distribute some skill points first
    before turning in a parchment for an item reward. See (8.5) for details!
    The winner parchments can also be given to other characters, but those will
    only be able to exchange them for a luck buff, not for an item-

    Loser parchments are not tradable and can only be turned in for a small
    temporary luck buff (about 30 minutes duration).
    For details about luck see LUCK flag in (5.8).

    Hints:
    -The Horned Reaper in this maze bashes doors instead of opening them.
    -If you stand still for a turn, you can 'run' over one adjacent floor grid
     as quickly as you can double-tap a movement key (maybe create a macro).
    -Players usually do not start next to rooms that have escape beacons.
    -Don't OCD this dungeon. Your goal is to pass through as many rooms as
     possible, not to cover areas "cleanly".
    -It is known that in a world of squares, moving diagonally has a certain
     advantage.


Asides from extermination orders and events, there is another, permanently
available challenge that waits for you to tackle it:

Ironman Deep Dive Challenge (IDDC)
    This is a special, gigantic ironman dungeon (or tower) which is 127 levels
    in size and does not allow recalling in between, except for in the two
    'dungeon towns' which will be generated at dungeon level 40 and 80. (More
    dungeon towns might spawn but won't allow recalling.) If you recall at such
    a town it counts as withdrawing from the challenge and you won't make it on
    the leaderboard that can be viewed at the mayor's office in Bree.
    (Note that 'IDDC-exclusive' characters can NOT recall out at static towns.
    If they try, they are just 'killed by indetermnation' and erased.)
    Monsters cannot spawn in the wilderness sector of the dungeon, so you can
    just idle at the entrance, waiting for team mates.

    The Deep Dive dungeon requires your character to have zero experience
    points in order to be eligible to enter.
    To fulfil that requirement you may not collect more than 300 Au (gold
    pieces) or pick up any items or money of other players. Also, if you eat a
    ration of food and you are unlucky enough that it's gone bad you will get
    1 xp for that.
    Use the /ex command to see how much more gold you may pick up.

    If you make a 'slot-exclusive' IDDC character, it will start out with 300
    extra gold, get at least a 50% discount in all shops, and in turn will
    automatically be unable to pick up any more gold or items of other players,
    and it won't get experience from eating bad food either. (It cannot buy
    houses either, but you won't need those anyway.)

    As IDDC-exclusive character you will get no experience when you kill a
    monsters outside of the IDDC. As a little extra bonus, slot-exclusive IDDC
    characters will also randomly gain knowledge of some item flavours on
    entering the IDDC dungeon. (Flavoured items are: potions, scrolls, rings,
    amulets, magic devices, mushrooms.)
    All characters that enter the IDDC will also get 20 scrolls of identify
    for free, which will automatically be placed into their inventory.

    Players in the IDDC receive a 20% experience gain bonus in addition to the
    usual 15% experience bonus all ironman dungeons provide, so overall you
    gain +35% more experience in IDDC than in a normal, generic dungeon.
    You could decide to 'abuse' IDDC to level up your character, and then leave
    the dungeon when you reach -2000 ft. This might be especially interesting
    for mimicry users (see further below).
    The IDDC does not enforce a minimum depth in regards to player level in
    order to gain optimal experience.
    On average the experience gained in IDDC is high enough, that even a
    character of a highly penalized race/class combination can still obtain at
    least level 46 before he reaches Nargothrond at -4000 ft, even if he skips
    all floors that give a "terrifying" feeling - if he clears out all other
    floors completely. This number is an average and may therefore vary.

    To further bring your character up to snuff on deeper levels, when you hit
    -3000 ft you will have a very high chance to find one very useful ring of
    speed. This high chance will stay in effect until you actually find it.
    This does not have to happen on -3000 ft, it can be on deeper levels too.
    As soon as you find it, your chance to find further rings of speed will
    revert back to normal.

    Since you cannot recall out aside from these two towns, except if you reach
    the 127th floor of the dungeon, it is extremely likely that you will die
    before making it through all those floors. So this dungeon serves as a
    challenge of how far you can make it before death!
    The level reached will be recorded in the mayor's office in Bree ('n' key
    inside the office, to view the records).

    To provide some more support, this dungeon will have additional, generic
    town levels at -1000 ft and -3000 ft. Monsters cannot spawn in any kind of
    dungeon town.
    Those towns remain static for only 5 minutes after dying, all other IDDC
    floors will remain static for 10 minutes, giving other players a chance to
    loot items and money. An exception are floors 50 ft..350ft which only stay
    static for 2 minutes, still giving you a chance to reconnect if you get
    disconnected without the floor turning stale.

    Also, starting at dungeon level 8, a hidden library may appear randomly
    (that's a book store with a red '9' for entrance), allowing you to purchase
    magic spells you might be missing. It also offers a special service to
    identify all items you are carrying.
    On very deep floors after Nargothrond, a seasoned alchemist store may
    appear, allowing you to resupply.

    Rogues should be aware that it's not possible to steal from general store,
    weaponsmith, armoury, temple, magic shop, black market and the special
    potion store in the dungeon towns.

    Inside the challenge dungeon you can acquire an extermination order via
    /xorder command at level 1 already, instead of the usual minimum level 5.
    On average, extermination orders in here require less monsters to be slain.
    Also, the monster level of the order will depend on the floor level instead
    of the player's level.

    The IDDC is randomly using themes of all the other dungeons, the selection
    is randomly rerolled every 24 hours. The final floor of each theme might
    spawn the according dungeon boss if you are lucky. The chance for a boss to
    spawn is even somewhat higher than in normal dungeons.
    Further, you will receive an feeling "You feel a commanding presence.."
    that indicates a dungeon boss spawn. Like yellow feeling messages, this too
    requires you to have stayed on the previous floor for about 2 minutes
    (until your depth indicator gets a light blue star attached).

    Although Sauron is the final guardian of Mt Doom, he may spawn in any theme
    in the IDDC, provided the floor depth is at least level 99.
    As in any other dungeon, Morgoth will only spawn if all players on a floor
    have already defeated Sauron. He may spawn in any theme, on floor depths of
    level 100 or deeper.

    For servers running 'strict_etiquette', meaning that a player will lose all
    true artifacts after winning: If Morgoth is defeated, players on his floor
    will be allowed to use Word of Recall to leave the dungeon if they wish!
    (Alternatively they may go on and recall at the final floor, which is
    level 127 aka -6350 ft.) 'Strict_etiquette' is usually turned off though.

    An IDDC-slot-exclusive character that makes it out of the dungeon will be
    restricted to the world surface. If it attempts to enter any dungeon or
    tower it will automatically retire instantly. Note that it cannot buy any
    houses, but it won't need those anyway.

    Usually unique monsters may not spawn in two or more places in the game
    world at once, but the IDDC is actually an exception. In here, a unique
    monster is allowed to spawn (once) on a floor even though another instance
    of it already exists right now elsewhere in the world.
    This means that you don't have to worry which uniques other players are
    currently fighting - they can still spawn for you just fine.

    Mimicry users gain +9 extra kill credit on each kill, effectively
    learning forms TEN TIMES as fast. (However, if that character decides to
    withdraw from the challenge at a static town, it loses 2/3 of those extra
    kill credits again, still not a bad deal.)

    Darklings and Candlebearers for Maiar spawn slightly earlier, from dungeon
    level 10 to 20 in the IDDC, instead of from 12 to 20 anywhere else in the
    world.

    After the first fixed town at -2000 ft, Menegroth, all further floors you
    enter will give you a progressively increasing (with floor depth) luck
    bonus, making it more and more likely to obtain better items.

    The IDDC does not allow forming a party or adding someone to an existing
    party, so you have to do this while everyone who wants to join the party is
    still outside of the IDDC.
    IDDC allows partying and trading between everlasting and non-everlasting
    characters. To form a party between those, everyone must be within the
    worldmap sector where the IDDC entrance is located.
    Level requirements on items are not in effect while inside the ironman deep
    dive challenge either, so item levels are meaningless.

    Party bonus experience is higher than outside of IDDC. This means that the
    experience you get per killed monster is much closer to the experience you
    would get for playing solo, making partying more attractive since you do
    not need to worry about 'loss' of experience compared to going solo.

    If the party leader dies inside the IDDC, the party isn't disbanded but
    ownership of the party is transferred to another party member. (Same as on
    Ironman server.)

    In case you need to go offline you'll just have to log out inside the
    dungeon. Keep in mind that your character will stay in the game for about
    30 more seconds during which it could be killed if in an unsafe place.
    Dungeon towns in general however are free of any monster spawns, so they
    are safe.

    If you log out in the IDDC and log back on before the level has changed,
    you can continue business as usual. However, if you log off and wait until
    the level has reset, then the level will be "stale" for you, the next time
    you log on, which will prevent you from getting any experience, items or
    gold until you move on by taking a staircase to the next floor.
    Therefore, if you need to log out and stop playing, you should first clear
    as many monsters as you can on your current floor before logging out. That
    way you won't "waste" any experience points.
    Note that dungeon towns never turn stale.

    Monsters cannot spawn 'live' in the IDDC, but only at the time of creation
    of each dungeon floor. Summon staves cannot be recharged in the IDDC and
    polymorphing magic does not work.

    NOTE: If you use stolen enchant scrolls on an item while you are in a town,
    then the item will get a 100% off discount. If you want to use stolen
    scrolls to enchant your items and keep the items sellable, then you have
    to take the staircase to leave the town, and read the scrolls in an actual
    dungeon level instead.

    NOTE: You can use the command '/convertexclusive' to convert one of your
    characters into a dedicated IDDC character, moving it to a specific
    IDDC-only-character slot and freeing up the generic character slot again.
    This of course only works if you still have a free IDDC-exclusive character
    slot available.


Seasonal events
---------------
At certain times of the year, some seasonal events will occur for a couple of
days each. The exact time of the day when they start or end can vary depending
on your time zone, even a date difference of +/-1 day is possible for that
reason. The ending date means that somewhen after the beginning of that day,
the event will end:

Halloween
    Running from 26th October till 2nd November.
    The server will recall all players (20 minutes ahead warning will be
    displayed) and restart. After that, Halloween is live and costumes can be
    found and stored costumes can be worn again.
    Townspeople will actually give experience (!) but also have a fear-causing
    'touch' attack. They can't really harm you, though.

    Randomly, the Great Pumpkin will appear on dungeon levels, either with low
    or medium or high amount of hit points, depending on the location.
    If you cannot beat the high-HP version, you could try leaving the floor to
    reset it and hope to see the Pumpkin randomly respawn quickly afterwards in
    easier form. The pumpkin will despawn on its own if it doesn't get defeated
    before one hour has passed after it appeared. It will quickly respawn on
    another dungeon level in that case. About 5 minutes before it fades away,
    nearby players will get a warning message, saying that the Great Pumpkin
    "wails and seems to fade".

    The Pumpkin is aiming at intermediate-level characters. It can spawn on any
    dungeon floor shallower than dungeon level 35 (or 40 on Ironman server*),
    except it won't show up on the first 19 floors in the Ironman Deep Dive
    Challenge.
    Players who are too high level (above 30 on main, above 35 on Ironman*)
    will not be able to hunt him, for the others he will still be tough and
    might require teamwork.

    The Great Pumpkin does not cause any damage but still has a few annoying
    spells at its disposal. It is level 127 and therefore can drop quite high-
    level items and usually drops very good stuff. Please share fairly. ;)
    When a player defeats the Great Pumpkin, everyone will get a message about
    it. The Great Pumpkin will randomly respawn again some time later.

    During Halloween, it will stay deep night on the world's surface and magic
    that lights up the world surface won't work.

    (* the 'Ironman' server, also called 'RPG' server, is currently not
    available. Instead, try the IDDC or Halls of Mandos, if you want to play
    ironman-style.)

Christmas
    Running from 23th December to 27th December.
    The server will recall all players (20 minutes ahead warning will be
    displayed) and restart, after which the event is live.
    During christmas, costumes can be worn again and you might even find Santa
    Claus costumes. Also, Santa Claus will spawn in town and drops great stuff
    when you uh.. kill him. :)

New year's eve
    Running from 31st December to 1st January.
    Fireworks will be launched into the sky of the town of Bree.
    While it's night and fireworks are being launched, magic that lights up the
    world surface will not work.



(4.14) In-game time system
--------------------------
Two time systems are relevant for the players' game experience:
-real time (you can check the server's time with /time command by the way)
-in-game 'turns'

Events for example are usually measured in real-time, ie /evinfo command will
return information that mentions minutes and seconds. This is, because event
information is 'out-of-game' information that is supposed to inform the player,
not the character played.

Most other things in-game are measured by the passing of 'game turns'.

Before explaining more about them, I'd like to interject that there is a second
meaning to the term 'turns' in the game, which is used to describe frames of
the game engine, usually running at 60 fps internally. Instead of just calling
those internal processing steps 'frames' as would be precise, unfortunately
they are also called 'turns'. But those 'frame-turns' aren't what we'll be
talking about here, since they don't matter to the players at all.
The only place players will ever come in contact with frame-turns unfortunately
is the high score board, which should probably really be changed to either
'in-game' turns or just to real days/hours/minutes, which make more sense.

So, how do game turns work?
They measure the time experienced by characters and monsters.
For example if you are poisoned then you will see your hit points ticking down.
This is done once each turn, so it will allow you to observe how long a turn
actually lasts in real time.
Same for lamp fuel: It runs out by -1 each turn.
The speed of characters and monsters also depends on game turns:
A creature moving at +0 speed can move once per game turn, while creatures at
higher speed may move several times per game turn, and of lower speed only once
in several game turns, depending on the exact speed.

Note that +SPEED is actually not linear in in-game time! To find out how often
your character can really move per game turn, use the /ex command. You will
find that increasing your speed more and more will yield somewhat diminishing
returns on the amount of actions your character can actually perform per turn.

An special thing about game turns is that their passing depends on the dungeon
level your character is on!
A turn in Bree, ie on the world surface, will last like about 1/2..2/3 seconds.
(You can for example observe the passing of turns if you watch your light
source losing fuel and hit CTRL+R to refresh the display and thereby take
measure points).
In the dungeon however, the time will pass slower. The deeper you are, the
slower game turns will pass in real-time. For example if you enter Mordor, you
might feel as if your character only moves at half his usual speed. This is
because each in-game turn is slowed down quite much on dungeon level 34, which
corresponds to the floor at Mordor -50 ft.
The reason for this is that higher level monsters usually move faster than
lower level monsters. This would make the game more and more dangerous to play,
since your reaction times would need to be *very* short. Actually much shorter
than is feasible.
To counter that, the whole time itself is just slowed down on deeper levels, to
allow you to react more easily.

Day/night change:
In the game there is day and night. Vampires burn if they move around in day
light without either a protective wrapping or an item that provides resistance
to light.
Wanderers in the wilderness in turn would rather prefer day light in order to
locate the entrance to that dungeon they are looking for.

The in-game day time can be checked with /ex chat command too.
Usually a whole day (day + night, ie full 24h in-game time cycle) will last for
slightly more than one hour real time.
The sun will usually rise at around 6am, while night falls at around 8pm, so
the in-game night lasts for slightly less than half an hour real time.
An in-game hour lasts for about 160 seconds in real-time.
Extermination orders (see (4.13)) usually have a time limit of two full in-game
days, so you will have about 2.5 h to carry them out.



(4.15) Swimming
---------------
Some very light characters can swim without losing hit points occasionally
('drowning). The weight limit includes equipment, backpack and the character's
weight itself. For example an elf has no problems swimming through deep water.

The heavier a character gets, the more often he will get a 'tick' of drowning
inflicted on him, reducing his hit points. This is a continuous process that
scales from 'no damage at all' at very low total weight to serious drowning for
really heavily packed characters.

Most races are too heavy to be able to swim perfectly out of the box, and even
low-weight races will run into trouble when they store things in their backpack
or wear a couple of items.
However, this is often not a big problem because even though a character may
not be able to swim perfectly, it'll still be sufficient to cross large rivers
without taking much of a dip in hit points, if he isn't carrying or wearing a
load of heavy items.


If you're really too heavy and want to operate in watery surroundings though?
Here are ways to improve your swimming capabilities:
----------------------------------------------------

Constitution or being undead (includes mimicked monster forms) will reduce the
hit point damage, but not the drowning tick frequency.
Strength and dexterity will randomly reduce the tick frequency but are still no
guarantee for perfect swimming.

The 'Swimming' skill is the easiest choice to reduce tick frequency, and it
does so to zero ie perfect swimming, when maxed. at 0.700 you will become able
to swim very fast, which can be compared to 'running' through the water in
terms of speed. However, this costs precious skill points, so it's not a very
popular way of getting good at crossing water.

Mimics and especially druids can use an aquatic form or a form that can swim
easily, and they will be able to cross water in the same way, without ever
drowning. Another way is to use a form that grants wraithform or simply a form
that grants levitation, which is a rather common ability.
Rangers learn how to swim at great skill at level 25, Martial Arts users will
be able to swim easily at a Martial Arts skill of 30.000.
Ents never drown since they're made of wood, while Draconians will actually
gain intrinsic levitation at level 30.
Characters training the magic 'Water' or 'Nature' school will acquire
water-passing at 40.000, while 'Air' school grants levitation at 50.000.
Other characters can rely on items that grant levitation, swimming (rare), or
wraithform (by spell or item) to become able to cross water easily. Levitation
is definitely the most popular choice, since you can 'fly' over water quickly.
Wraithform is as good as levitation, but hard to acquire.

In short: Obtaining levitation is probably the most popular way for crossing
larger areas of water.



(4.16) Teleportation
--------------------
Teleportation is the magical, instantaneous relocation of a player or monster.

There are five main types of teleportation:
-Phase door/Blink
  It follows the same rules as 'teleport self', it's just named differently to
  indicate that it is limited to a rather short range (usually less than 20
  grids away).
  The spell available to players are usually called 'Phase Door' while the
  spell used by monsters is usually called 'blink', but again that's just a
  matter of naming.
  Note that monsters cannot blink out of vaults.
-Teleport self
  The normal 'teleportation' as provided by scrolls, staves or used by monsters
  which has a very long range and also tries to keep a certain minimum range to
  make sure you actually get away from trouble.
  Note that monsters cannot teleport out of vaults.
-Teleport other
  It's basically the same as normal teleportation, except it does teleport a
  targetted player/monster instead of the invoking player/monster himself.
  If you get teleported by someone you cannot see, instead of his name you will
  see this message: "Someone teleports you away!"
  Note that monsters cannot teleport you away if you're within a no-teleport
  area (no-tele vault).
-Teleport-to
  Thes spell tries to move the targetted player or monster onto a grid next to
  the caster. This can be nasty when monsters with dangerous melee attacks cast
  teleport-to on a player who tried to keep his distance.
  Note that teleport-to has no effect if the source grid or the destination
  grid are in a no-teleport area (no-tele vault).
-Word of recall
  The only non-instantaneous teleportation spell and the one with the longest
  range. After a certain 'charge' phase has elapsed it will teleport the player
  over the world map or into or out of a dungeon.

Further rules that determine the target location:
-Neither monsters nor players can teleport into vaults or houses or into shops.
-Monsters cannot land on grids that have a glyph or rune on it, or on
 'protected' grids (the inns and the arena event corners).
-Players cannot land on grids that are inside monster nests/pits, including the
 outer corridor around them (pits/nests are rectangular rooms surrounded by a
 one-space-wide outer passage, that are filled to the brim with monsters).
 Note: Earthquakes or *destruction* magic will cancel the special protected
 state of pit/nest grids, so they become valid teleportation destinations
 again.

However, under certain conditions, teleportation spells may still fail!
In general for all teleportation attempts, these are:

-Teleport spells cast onto others (teleport other, teleport-to) may get
 resisted by the target depending on its saving throw, level or status.
-Trying to teleport while engaged in pvp with a pvp-character. There will be
 a cooldown of maybe half a minute after a pvp-mode fight till you can use
 teleportation again. If you try to flee by teleportation, you will receive a
 yellow message: "There's no easy way out of this fight!" >:)
-Certain special floors ('Dungeon Keeper' event or an experimental no-teleport
 dungeon).
-Trying to teleport in a local no-teleport area.
 When you enter such an area (no-tele vaults) you will see a message in dark
 grey, saying "The air in here feels very still". Music will change too, and
 your speed and worldmap indicator will change colour to grey, to catch your
 attention.
 When you try to teleport you will get a message in bright red, saying:
 "This location suppresses teleportation!"
-Trying to teleport while having equipped an amulet of anti-teleportation or
 activated a space-time-anchor effect. You will get an orange message, saying:
 "You are surrounded by an anti-teleportation field!"
-Trying to teleport on a floor that has no or only few free floor grids.
 Teleportation magic tries hard to find a free destination grid, but if it is
 unlucky due to a low number of available grids it might just fail. So it is
 not recommended for example for an istar to cast stone prison all over the
 level, filling it mostly up. This puts attempts to successfully teleport on
 this level at hazard.
 'Free' floor grid means a floor grid that doesn't have a monster or item on
 it and is classified as 'floor' (water and lava count as floor too).
 If a teleportation spell fails because it didn't find a free destination grid
 you will see an orange message "The teleportation spell strangely fizzles!".



(5) Item and monster details
============================

(5.1) Melee weapons, brands
---------------------------
One of TomeNET's features is the "auto-retaliator". This means, if an enemy
enters a field that is adjacent to you, you will automatically attack the foe
with your equipped melee weapon. This is helpful against lags as well as for
preventing RSI ;) - for details about auto-retaliation please see (4.1a).

Melee weapons have at least three stats, it's 'damage dice', 'to-hit' and
'to-damage'. 'To-hit' helps you actually not miss an enemy, 'to-dam' increases
the damage. The 'damage dice' shows how many dice are added to calculate the
random damage you inflict on an enemy as you hit!

Example:  Broad Sword (2d5) (+3,+4)
This means, your chance to hit is a bit increased (+3) and you will inflict
a damage of: 2 dice with 5 sides each, to the result +4 is added.
So the damage you inflict will randomly vary from 6 (1+1+4) up to 14 (5+5+4)
meaning that you do an average damage of 10 per hit with that weapon
([6+14]/2 = 10).

A very important thing about melee weapons is that, depending on your strength
and dexterity as well as the weight of your melee weapon, you might be able to
deliver more than just one blow per round with it!
For example a warrior might be able to swing his "Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+0)"
one time per round, delivering 2*(1..5) damage. The 'd' means dice, so it's
like throwing 2 dice with 5 sides each and adding their values to estimate the
damage you inflicted on the victim. Now if that warrior equips a light whip
which weighs only 3 pounds (the broad sword weighs 15 pounds) he might get 2
or even 3 swings per round! Since a whip does 1d6 damage, he would deal
(assumed he got 2 hits) 2* 1*(1..6) damage, which in total is more damage per
round than he would deliver using the broad sword! Let's compare what happens
if the warrior magically enchants the damage of both weapons, using "Scrolls
of Enchant Weapon To-Dam" (these scrolls can be bought in shop '5').
One of these scrolls can enchant a weapon so one extra point is added to the
damage dice after they have been added. If we manage to enchant the damage of
the broad sword 9 times, the weapon will look like this:
"Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+9)"
That means after 2 dice with 5 sides each have been added up, there will be
further 9 points of damage added to the result!

Broad Sword 2d5 (+0,+9) 1 blow per round  -->  1* [ 2*(1..5) + 9 ] damage
  -->  2*((1+5)/2) + 9 average damage which is 15 per round.

Whip 1d6 (+0,+9) 2 blows per round  -->  2* [ 1*(1..6) + 9 ] damage
  -->  2* [ 1*(3,5) +9 ]  -->  2*12,5 = 25 damage per round!
       Far more than with the broad sword.

As you can see, the additional damage caused by enchantment will
be added to the dice result.

If you manage to get your hands on an item that imbues your melee weapon with
an elemental brand (like a Ring Of Ice for example), the dice of your weapon
will be multiplied by 2 if the target doesn't resist that brand.
See (5.3) to get an easy overview.

Characters using weapons have a limited number of melee attacks per round,
depending on the character class . A table showing the blows/round limits
is at section (6.5).

There are four different classes of melee weapons,
swords/daggers, blunt weapons, axes, polearms. (Also see (5.1a) below!)
You may inspect a weapon by pressing 'I' to see its base class.
For items listed in a store, the command is 'x' to examine it.
Those again are divided into four sub-classes each:
Single-handed, forced two-handed, should-be-wielded-two-handed,
may-be-wielded-two-handed. If you inspect a weapon, it will tell you if
it belongs to one of the latter three sub-classes:
"It must be wielded two-handed" (MUST2H)
"It should be wielded two-handed" (SHOULD2H)
"It may be wielded two-handed" (COULD2H)

While smaller melee weapons require only 1 hand to use them, some larger
weapons need 2 hands. Using a shield together with those is not possible.
Some larger weapons that should be used two-handed can also be used
single-handed, but you will receive penalties to to-hit and to-dam bonus if
you use it that way. Look at your character screen ('C') to compare the
to-hit/to-dam boni and see if it's worth it. You'll see a warning message
"Using this large weapon together with a shield makes fighting harder."

Medium weapons which 'may' be used two-handed won't give malus if used
single-handed, but you might get more blows per round if you wield them with
both hands! Again check your character screen ('C') to spot any difference.
You'll see "Without shield, your weapon feels especially easy to swing.".
Depending on weapon weight, your strength and your dexterity, sometimes you
get more blows/round from it, sometimes you don't.

If you try to wield a weapon that is too heavy for your character, meaning
your 'STRength' stat isn't high enough yet, you'll get a warning message:
"You have trouble wielding such a heavy weapon".
This means you won't get any benefits from your 'Weaponmastery' skill, nor
any extra blows per round at all, instead you'll be stuck with 1 blow/round.
Also, you'll be more prone to disarming attacks.

Similar is possible for shields. If you try to use a shield which is too heavy
for you, you'll get another warning message:
"You have trouble wielding such a heavy shield".
That means you will hardly be able to deflect anything with this shield and
won't get get any 'reflection' ability from it, if it provides this.
All other abilities you gain from it are not affected though (eg resistances
or stat boni), you will benefit from these just fine.

Your character might have a chance to parry attacks with his weapon and block
attacks with his shield, provided he uses one.
For more details about class-specific ability to utilize weapons and
shields for parrying and blocking, see (6.5), for more details about parrying
and blocking in general see (6.11).
In general, the bigger a weapon the more you may parry, while the bigger a
shield the more you will block!
Last but not least, training "Weaponmastery" skill will also increase your
parry chance a good deal.


(5.1a) Melee weapon types
-------------------------
As mentioned previously, there are four weapon classes:
Swords, axes, blunt weapons (whips, hammers, morning stars etc.), polearms.

You may wonder which one to choose and why. In general, if your character is
especially skilled at one of the four masteries you might want to pick that one
to save skill points (for example Half-Trolls get a bonus on Blunt-mastery).

Also, priests cannot use edged weapons that aren't 'blessed' (a special magical
property, ie ego-power), so if you want to create a melee-oriented priest,
you will usually pick blunt weapons (or 'Martial Arts' instead, for weaponless
combat, making more for a monk-style character).

However, if you have a choice or don't care about a few skill points more, you
may want to consider the following table to help you make a decision:


Type       1h/1.5+2h abundance  2h top damage/weight  Base item level 1+1.5h/2h
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swords**   very high / medium   medium / medium       low / mid
Axes*      medium / medium      high / heavy          low / high
Blunt      medium / high        high / very heavy     low / mid
Polearms*  low / high           high / medium         low / mid
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Note that these weapon types can (partially) obtain VORPAL mod from 'Sharp'
 or 'Spinning' ego power (see (5.8)):
 ** For randarts, only swords can spawn the VORPAL mod:
 Damage-wise 2h-swords with VORPAL flag can make up somewhat for the damage gap
 towards the top tier weapons of the other weapon classes.
 VORPAL mod makes an especially big difference in scenarios that are low on
 critical hits (ie no CRIT item flag or Critical-strike skill being applied).

For example if you stick with dual-wielding two weapons, you might want to go
with swords and definitely not with polearms, since there are a lot of 1h
swords, and very few 1h polearms.

The base item level determines at which depth you will start finding that item.
Also, normal town stores usually only sell low level weapons and armour while
black markets tend to prefer mid (normal black market) or high (special black
markets) level items.

In-game you can press 'I' (or 'x' if inside a store) to inspect an item.
Even if you haven't *identified* it, it will still tell you the weapon class
the item belongs to, if it is a weapon.

(Swords can be damaged by acid-based attacks, all other weapon types can be
damaged by both fire- and acid-based attacks.)



(5.2) Ranged Weapons, brands
----------------------------
Ranged weapons are not to be underestimated, they can be very powerful.
Especially characters with low Hit Points will love them since approaching
hordes can be killed at a distance or at least driven back, so they won't come
close and hit the player with devastating blows. It is recommended that you
equip a ranged weapon as soon as possible, and enchant its 'to-damage' to at
least +7 !

Ranged weapons have to-hit and to-dam like melee weapons, but instead of
dice they have a 'multiplier'.

Example:  Ranged weapon is:  Long Bow (x3) (+0,+5)
          Ammunition is:     65 Arrows (1d4) (+0,+2)
If you shoot an arrow, it will inflict
( 1d4 +2 +5 ) * 3 damage on the victim. The dice of the arrow varies from 1
up to 4, so we can do a damage of 24 up to 33, so the average damage is 28,5.
We can see here that ranged weapons can do a lot of damage :)

Ranged weapons will be placed in equipment slot 'c)'. After you equipped one,
you need to also equip ammunition that will be used. For example if you use a
long bow, you need to fill your quiver with some arrows. (w)ield the arrows,
and they will be placed into equipment slot 'm)', the ammo slot.
A macro that shoots at the target closest to you, looks like this:  *tf-
Explanation in case you really want to know: * means entering targetting mode
and choosing nearest target, t means exiting target mode and remember currently
selected target, f means fire, - means to aim at previously acquired target if
it's valid and otherwise to cancel the action.
To automatically pick up your arrows simply inscribe them:  !=
To inscribe an item press '{' key, to remove an inscription press '}'.
Ranged weapons can also auto-retaliate, that means you will fire automatically
at targets on sight. See (4.1a) for details about auto-retaliation.
However, auto-retaliating with a ranged weapon works only if the enemy stands
on an adjacent field, so use 'fire-till-kill' mode in general!

The dice of ammunition are also effected by brands and slays same as normal
weapons but the additional damage is reduced to 2/5.
Example: Ring of Acid will usually add 1x your melee base damage (weapon dice).
For ranged weapons it will add 1*2/5x of your base damage (arrow dice), so
multiply the average arrow dice result by 1.4 instead of by 2 to get your total
damage output. See (5.3) to get an easy overview.

If you try to wield a ranged weapon that is too heavy for your character,
meaning your 'STRength' stat isn't high enough yet, you'll get a warning
message:
"You have trouble wielding such a heavy bow".
That means you'll get neither any benefits from your 'Archery' skill nor from
any particular ranged mastery (extra shots!) at all when using that weapon.

Note: +damage bonus from other items besides the ranged weapon itself or the
ammunition it uses will not be added to ranged attacks, while +hit bonus will.
This means for example that 'a Ring of Slaying (+10,+12)' will add +10 to both
your melee hit chance and your ranged hit chance, but the +12 damage will only
be added to your melee damage, not your ranged.

Also see 'Armour weight (concerning ranged weapons)' further below in (5.5)
for details about how wearing armour affects your ranged weapon accuracy.


(5.2a)  Fire-till-kill mode
----------------------------
Accessible via 'm' key, you can switch 'fire-till-kill' mode on or off.
While enabled, your character will keep firing a ranged weapon (ie a weapon in
your 'shooter' equipment slot) once you initiated the first shot until the
target either dies or direct firing at it becomes impossible/obstructed for any
reason.
The main use besides making ranged weapon usage more relaxed is that you are
able to single out enemies you want to kill of big monster packs such as
escorts.

Fire-till-kill mode also works with spells and runes, same as with ranged
weapons, except it may stop under additional conditions such as having no more
mana or other effects that render you 100% unable to cast spells.
While it will also stop if your spell requires a clear line of sight and would
(while travelling to the target) hit other monsters on the way, some spells
which don't travel to their destination but arrive instantly (most notably ball
spells and mindcrafter spells) will not be affected by monsters crossing your
line of sight.

To manually stop fire-till-kill without moving or performing any other action,
just press the SPACE key. Note that SPACE also stops all other kinds of
repeatable actions such as searching or tunnelling.

Fire-till-kill does not work with any other type of attacks besides those
mentioned above.



(5.3) Slaying vs brands
-----------------------
If you use a weapon that slays trolls, that means its dice will be doubled if
you hit a troll ('T'). If you have an item that gives fire brand, the dice
would also be doubled by the brand. Slaying and brands are not cumulative.
That means you will get a total dice multiplier of 2 here.
Brands don't stack. The best one is taken. So if you wear a ring of fire and
your weapon does cold damage the dice will be multiplied by 2 if the target
doesn't resist both heat and cold. If the target is susceptible to one of
those the dice are multiplied by 4. Same goes for SLAY flags.

Combat Type | Dice multiplier for brands (fire/cold/acid/lightning/poison)
            | Monster..
            | ..is immune   | ..resists | ..doesn't resist  | ..is susceptible
------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
Melee Weapon|       1             1.5             2                   4
Ranged Weap.|       1             1.2             1.4                 2.2
Martial Arts|       1             1.25            1.5                 2.5

Slaying     | Dice multiplier | Description
------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
Slay Animal |       1.5       | It is esp. deadly against natural creatures.
Slay Giant  |       2         | It is especially deadly against giants.
Slay Undead |       2         | It strikes at undead with holy wrath.
Slay Troll  |       2         | It is especially deadly against trolls.
Slay Orc    |       2         | It is especially deadly against orcs.
Slay Dragon |       2         | It is especially deadly against dragons.
Slay Demon  |       2         | It strikes at undead with holy wrath.
Slay Evil   |       1.5       | It fights against evil with holy fury.
Kill Undead |       3         | It is a great bane of undead.
Kill Dragon |       3         | It is a great bane of dragons.
Kill Demon  |       3         | It is a great bane of demons.

Same as in the 'brands' table, x1.5 will become x1.2 for ranged weapons and
x1.17 for Martial Arts, x2 becomes x1.4 and x1.33 and x3 will become x1.8
and x1.67 respectively.

Giants, Undead, Trolls, Orcs, Dragons, Demons are all 'Evil'.

If several multipliers match the highest one will be used.

For ranged weapons, the damage calculated from brands/slays applied to ammo
dice will further be multiplied by the bow's multiplier (x2..x5, depending on
the type of sling, bow or crossbow).


(5.3a) Martial Arts, brands
---------------------------
The "auto-retaliator" (see (4.1a)) also works if you fight bare-handed.

Training Martial Arts will give you..
-a bonus to-hit and to-dam.
-special combat moves which your character will use automatically.
 These moves do a lot of extra damage and often additionally stun or slow
 your opponent.
-special abilities and resistances (like Free Action, see (6.2) for details).
-extra speed and stealth bonus.
-extra AC bonus for each part of armour that is NOT worn.
 Increasing your Martial Arts skill lets you wear light and even medium armour
 and still benefit from its AC.
-a chance to grab your enemies to prevent them from casting or teleporting.
 (This chance adds to your interception skill.)

However, to use the full potential of martial arts you will need to take care
of several points..
-a very light backpack will give martial artists a small additional speed and
 stealth bonus. (No warning message here.)
-a very heavy backpack will nullify the abilities and resistances,
 as well as the speed and stealth bonus! You will see a red warning message,
 telling you about weight encumberment:
 "You can't move freely due to your backpack weight."
-using too heavy armour will cut your number of blows per round to half, and
 nullify your to-hit, to-dam, speed and stealth bonus from MA.
-using a melee or ranged weapon or carrying a very heavy backpack will nullify
 the AC bonus from Martial Arts, and greatly reduce your number of blows per
 round.
-using a melee or ranged weapon or a shield will nullify the special combat
 styles, reducing your damage.
-using a melee or ranged weapon or a shield or wearing too heavy armour will
 reduce additional interception bonus gained from Martial Arts skill to zero.
-using a heavy shield, melee or ranged weapon will nullify your speed and
 stealth bonus.

The backpack weight limit includes the weight of your equipment and is
depending on your strength and Martial Arts skill. It is
10.0 lb + (str_wgt * 2.0 lb) + ((str_wgt + 5) * rounddown(skill * 0.1 lb)).

Here's a table to tell you the values for str_wgt:
(Warning message is: "You can't move freely due to your backpack weight.")

        str_wgt     STRength of             str_wgt     STRength of
                    the character                       the character
        -------------------------           -------------------------

        9           7                       20          18/00-18/09
        10          8                       22          18/10-18/19
        11          9                       24          18/20-18/29
        12          10                      26          18/30-18/39
        13          11                      28          18/40-18/49
        14          12                      30          18/50-18/220+
        15          13

The armour weight limit is 5.0 lb + Martial Arts skill level * 0.42 lb.
So for MA 50 it is 5.0 + 21.0 = 26.0 lb.
If your armour becomes too heavy, you will see this warning message:
"Your armour weight strains your martial arts performance."


Here's a table, for those who prefer this view:

Equipment/inventory  | +hit/dam  abilities  styles  spd/stl  +AC  grab  blows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Light backpack       |                                 +

Heavy shield/weapons |                                 0


Martial Arts special combat moves have certain dice, similar to normal
weapons. These dice are also effected by brands and slays same as normal
weapons but the additional damage is reduced to 1/3.
Example: Ring of Acid will usually add 1x your base damage.
For MA it will add 1/3 of your base damage, so multiply your base damage
by 1.33 instead of by 2 to get your total damage output.
See (5.3) to get an easy overview.

You cannot use special moves while stunned or confused.

Here is a list of Martial Arts special moves:
A move is picked randomly, then used if random(1..MA_Skill)>chance.
If the chance fails, another move is picked.
There are MA_Skill / 7 tries to find a move, otherwise you will hit
without a special move. There is always at least 1 try to pick a
move.

Depending on your MA skill, you have a fixed number of barehanded attacks
per round, independent of your character class, your strength or your
dexterity (unlike characters that use weapons):
(The attack number can be increased further by items like rings of extra
attacks or by magical influence like priest prayer 'Zeal'.)
Note that EA effects (like EA ring or Zeal prayer) won't work on characters
who fight barehanded without having Martial Arts skill at 01.000 or higher!

Martial Arts users have a higher risk of being infected with Black Breath
from high undead monsters than weapon-users.
Also, they have a high risk of being badly cut if a monster uses a disarming
attack against them.



(5.4) Application of attack-affecting item mods
-----------------------------------------------
While item abilities such as resistances or stat boosts are always applied,
magical mods that affect attacks might not be.
Such mods are:

+to-hit, +to-dam, extra attacks, critical hits, vampiric, slays and brands.

These mods on weapons are only applied to attacks done with that particular
weapon.
Except for 'extra attacks', which generally increases your number of attacks
and will not discriminate which weapon will be used for attacking if you are
dual-wielding - both weapons always have a 50% chance each blow.

These mods on other items, like gloves or rings, will affect all weapons,
even ranged ones, and also martial arts!
Exceptions:
 - +to-dam boni will not be applied to ranged weapons, only to melee attacks.
 - Extra attacks are not applied to ranged weapons, only to melee attacks.
 - Vampirism effect will be weaker (compare table at the end of (5.15)).



(5.5) Weight of weapons and armour
----------------------------------
Weight of items in your inventory or equipment can have great effect on
martial artists. If you use martial arts, also see (5.3a) for more information.

Even if you're not using martial arts, there are certain types of encumberment
which may affect your character:


Weapon weight
-------------
If your melee weapon or ranged weapon is too heavy you will hardly be able
to use it, resulting in reduced attack number per round and less damage.
You will get the message "You have trouble wielding such a heavy weapon/bow"
and probably your blows will drop to 1 and tohit/todam go near to zero.
A weapon is too heavy for you if its weight is greater than the so-called
str_hold value. Below is a table with the str_hold values, depending on a
character's strength:

        str_hold    STRength of             str_hold    STRength of
                    the character                       the character

        30          18/00-18/09             90          18/190-18/199

        35          18/20-18/29             100         18/210-18/219
        40          18/30-18/39             100         18/220+


Armour weight (concerning magic)
--------------------------------
Wearing armour which is too bulky gives you this message:
"The weight of your armour strains your spellcasting."
That means your mana will be (severely) reduced from the bulkiness of your
armour. To counter this effect, train your 'Combat' skill.
To cast freely, you may wear 15.0 to 30.0 lb of armour (depending on your
class and hence the type of magic you utilize) plus your combat skill (in
0.3 lb). Here is a table illustrating the values:

Adventurer    21.0 lb
Warrior       -
Istar         15.0 lb
Priest        25.0 lb
Rogue         20.0 lb
Mimic         28.0 lb
Archer        -
Paladin       30.0 lb
Ranger        22.0 lb
Druid         20.0 lb
Shaman        17.0 lb
Runemaster    23.0 lb
Mindcrafter   26.0 lb (and will get penalty for head gear heavier than 4.0 lb)

So 50 points in 'Combat' would allow a paladin to wear 30.0 + 15.0 =
45.0 lb of armour parts without receiving mana penalty from being encumbered.
In general, praying is the easiest-to-use form of magic, and weaving spells
the most difficult one.
Your total armour weight is the sum of the weight of any armour pieces worn
on head (helmet), body, hands, feet, and your cloak. Note that the weight of
a possibly equipped shield does not matter here (experimental).


Armour weight (concerning sneakiness/to-hit boni)
-------------------------------------------------
Wearing armour which is too heavy for you will reduce speed bonus from
'Sneakiness' skill and your to-hit boni received from your dexterity and weapon
class' mastery skill (eg Sword-mastery).
You will receieve a warning message, telling you:
"The weight of your armour encumbers your movement."
To move freely, you may wear 10.0 lb of armoury plus a strength-factor plus
0.6 * your combat skill. Strength factor is 0.6 * str_hold (see table above to
find your str_hold). So the top weight limit is

10.0 + 0.6 * 50 (combat) + 0.6 * 100 (str_hold) = 100.0 lb.

(Inspecting an item causing this type of encumberment would display that it
encumbers "your movement" accordingly.)


Armour weight (concerning flexibility boni and abilities)
---------------------------------------------------------
Some special abilities depend on armour weight (including shield) too.
Those are..
-dodge chance from 'Dodging' skill.
-critical hit bonus from 'Critical-strike' skill.
-extra parry bonus from dual-wielding two weapons. (Also see (6.11).)
-extra blow/round bonus from dual-wielding two weapons.
-area searching for the 'Rogue' class (exclusive ability).
-cloaking mode for the 'Rogue' class (exclusive ability).

If the armour becomes too heavy to perform those, a message will appear:
"The weight of your armour strains your flexibility and awareness."

This 'rogueish weight limit' (the skills are mostly used by rogues) is:
20.0 + (Combat skill * 6 / 50) lb, ie max 26.0 lb.

IMPORTANT: If you get the above flexibility warning message, that means your
           secondary weapon is NOT APPLIED AT ALL!
           So you won't receive any boni/resistances/whatever from it, it's
           basically as if you don't have it equipped at all.


Armour weight (concerning ranged weapons)
-----------------------------------------
If you wear a shield on your arm, no matter its weight and your strength, your
hit chance with ranged weapons will be reduced by this encumberment. You will
get an orange message saying
"You find it hard to aim while carrying your shield."
and a yellow '}' icon will appear in the encumberment bar.

Also, the greater your total equipped armour weight is, the more your ranged
to-hit bonus is reduced. This is a fluent, continuous process, and therefore
it's not considered an 'encumberment' per se, ie you won't see any icons in
the encumberment bar about this.


Glove encumberment (concerning magic)
-------------------------------------
Wearing gloves as a sorceror may reduce your maximum mana points if they are
not magically enchanted, such as:
Providing 'Free Action' / increasing your mana / increasing your dexterity.
You will receive a warning message, saying:
"Your covered hands feel unsuitable for spellcasting."


Also see (3.2) at the end of the chapter, for information about the
'Encumberment status line'.


Very heavy armour and/or heavy items in your inventory may also slow you down
(slightly reduce your moving speed) if your STRength isn't very great.



(5.6) Resistances & caps, Immunities, Susceptibilities
------------------------------------------------------

Resistances & caps
------------------
Several monsters or traps can cause elemental attacks on you. These attacks
can deliver very high damage if you do not 'resist' the specific attack type.
Those 'resistances' become very important in deeper dungeons where many
monsters are able to breathe on you with devastating power.

Permanent resistances (for example if you wear a ring and an armor that both
give fire resistance) will not stack. So one item is suffient for each
resistance. There is no difference if it's a helmet or an armour.
However, a temporary resistance (by potion or spell) and a permanent
resistance can stack (NOTE: This only applies to base and poison resistance,
base ones being fire, cold, electricity and acid).
That means if you quaff a 'potion of resist heat' (temporary resistance) and
wear an armour of fire resistance (permanent resistance) fire attacks will do
only 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 of the original damage.
This is known as 'double resistance'.
For more information on resistance/ability stacking see (5.17).

For all attacks the following way of how the final damage is calculated
applies:
If a monster breathes, that attack often has a damage potential of 1/3 of
the monster's hit points.
This 'raw' damage will now be capped at a maximum value that varies for the
different types of attacks.
If you 'resist' that attack, the damage will be cut to further 1/3 (this
value varies for the different types of attacks).

Example:
An Ancient Red Dragon breathes fire.
It has 1500 HP. The fire breath would do approx. 500 damage.
The damage cap for fire attacks is 1200. So the value of 500 remains.
Let's assume that your character resists fire. The damage will be cut down
to 1/3 now, leaving 170 damage.
Example 2:
A Great Hell Wyrm :) breathes fire.
It has 5000 HP. The fire breath would do approx. 1700 damage.
Since 1700 is greater than the cap (1200) it becomes 1200.
Let's assume your character resists fire. The damage will be cut down to 1/3,
leaving approx. 400 damage.


Global damage cap
------------------
Breath damage is capped, the number is given in the corresponding description
and actual breath damage generally depends on the monster's current hit points.

Bolts and balls depend damage-wise on the level of the casting monster as the
formulas show and is not as strictly capped as breath damage.

However, all breaths and magical attacks (such as bolts and ball spells) are
subject to a global magical damage cap of 1600. Even though breaths are not
strictly magical spells.
Keep in mind that susceptibility may still double that damage though, as it is
applied _after_ the global damage cap. So a susceptible target could suffer up
to 3200 damage.


There are four so-called 'basic resistances'. These are
-------------------------------------------------------
Fire/Heat               These attacks can burn items in your inventory.
                        They can also damage your equipment.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your strength.
                        Fire bolts do (level/3)+(9d8) damage.
                        Fire balls do (level*7/2)+10 damage.
                        Fire breaths do HP / 3 damage, capping at 1200.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory from getting harmed (5.10), (5.17).
                        Potions of resist heat are a cheap way to attain
                        double-resistance for a short time in order to pass
                        lava streams without your inventory taking damage.
Frost/Cold              These attacks can shatter potions.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your strength.
                        Frost bolts do (level/3)+(6d8) damage.
                        Cold balls do (level*2)+10 damage.
                        Cold breaths do HP / 3 damage, capping at 1200.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory from getting harmed (5.10), (5.17).
Lightning/Electricity   These attacks can destroy rings, damage amulets
                        (reducing their (+X) bonus pval) and discharge magic
                        devices, draining their charges (or energy in case of
                        rods).
                        Without resistance it can reduce your dexterity.
                        Lightning bolts do (level/3)+(4d8) damage.
                        Lightning balls do (level*3/2)+8 damage.
                        Lightning breaths do HP / 3 damage, capping at 1200.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory from getting harmed (5.10), (5.17).
Acid                    These attacks can destroy items in your inventory.
                        They can also damage your equipment.
                        Without resistance it can reduce your charisma.
                        Acid bolts do (level/3)+(7d8) damage.
                        Acid balls do (level*3)+15 damage.
                        Acid breaths do HP / 3 damage, capping at 1200.
                        Immunity or double resistance protects items in your
                        inventory from getting harmed (5.10), (5.17).

Note: Equipment is mostly safe, except that some weapons can take damage from
coming in contact with fire, acid or water, depending on the item type.
Also, armour can be damaged by fire, acid or water, depending on its material.
Items which ignore an element, resist it, or even provide immunity against it
are unaffected by any attack of that type and won't take damage.
Taking damage means that weapons will lose +dam enchantment, and armour will
will lose +AC enchantment, so you can repair them again by reenchanting them.
If your character resists a specific element, the chance of any item getting
damaged by it is reduced. Having double resistance will reduce it much further
even.
Note that double resistance will completely prevent any inventory damage from
the elements; this is especially important for characters who carry a lot of
potions that they don't want to get destroyed by cold-based attacks.
If your character is immune to an element (see further down), that  will
completely prevent any sort of damage from that particular element for any item
you carry, wield or wear.
All artifacts are completely immune to any elemental damage.

Breath damage before capping is monster HP/3. Damage of these attacks is capped
at 1200 (always before resistances are applied).
If you resist them, the damage will be cut to 1/3. If you are susceptible to
them, like Ents to fire, you will take twice the damage! This also applies for
aura attacks like hitting someone who wears a cloak of immolation.
To prevent side-effects of the attacks on your inventory from occurring you
will need the according immunity! Resistance is only sufficient to protect
your equipment, not your inventory.
While wands and staves can be destroyed by according elemental attacks, rods
cannot be destroyed but only discharged (see elemental attack list above).


Semi-high resistances
---------------------
Poison          Poison resistance doesn't belong to the basic resistances but
                to the high resistances, yet is also very essential already
                from the early stages of your character's life on.
                If you resist poison you will not only take just 1/3 of the
                poison damage but also be protected from poisoning effects.
                Breath damage before capping is monster HP/3. Poison breath
                caps at 800.
                Stinking clouds, which are small poison balls, inflict 12d2
                damage.
Unbreath        A special type of poison, castable by mages.
                This one will deprive the air of all oxygen, thereby also deal
                damage to otherwise poison-immune monsters.
                The only monsters immune to this are those that do not require
                to breathe, which means undead, greater demons, angels and
                nonliving constructs.


Make sure that you have the basic resistances as soon as possible, and poison
resistance before going into deeper Mordor. Also, get 'Free Action' before
going as deep as about -1000 ft or deeper since many monsters can paralyze you.


There are also five minor resistances:
--------------------------------------
Fear            While you're afraid you won't be able to attack a target in
                close combat.
Blindness       You cannot read scrolls or books while you're blind.
                Blindness can be caused directly by a blindness attack or by
                indirectly by light or darkness attacks if you don't resist
                those. You still can use magic staves, rods or wands and
                quaff potions. Quaffing a potion of Healing, Curing or
                Cure Critical Wounds will remove the blindness.
Confusion       While confused you cannot move, shoot or fight straight.
                Further, you're unable to read scrolls or books.
                However, you still can use staves, wands and rods.
                Quaffing a potion of Healing, Curing or Cure Serious/Critical
                Wounds will remove the confusion.
                Resisting confusion or chaos will lower damage to 5/7..5/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Confusion damage caps at 400.
                Confusion resistance is covered by chaos resistance, so if you
                already resist chaos then you don't need any more items that
                give confusion resistance.
                (Monsters that have the NO_CONF flag will resist somewhat and
                suffer less damage.)
Paralysis       Paralysis can be caused by bashing doors, lack of food, by
                traps and by monsters. Against the latter two effects you can
                become immune by equipping a 'Free Action' item. You should
                become immune to paralysis before descending below 1000 ft.
Hold Life       This will provide some protection against experience drain;
                it won't help against experience drain inflicted by items you
                equipped though.

Note: 'Feather Falling' reduces damage taken from gravity attacks, although it
is technically not a resistance. 'Levitation' includes 'Feather Falling', so if
you have a source granting you levitation then you don't need another one for
feather falling. (Same as chaos resistance also gives confusion resistance.)


Further, there are several high resistances:
--------------------------------------------
(Poison         was described above, at the end of the basic resistances.)
Water           Water resistance is rare (an *ID*ed item will say
                'it provides resistance to unleashed water').
                Water attacks can stun and confuse you if you don't resist
                them and usually do a lot of damage.
                Resistance will cut damage to 1/3.
                If you're a mimicking an aquatic monster the damage will be
                further cut down to 1/4.
                If you don't wear a 'tarpaulin' items in your inventory might
                be destroyed by the water (if they don't resist water).
                Water bolts do (10d10)+level damage.
                Water balls do 50+(1...[level*5/2]) damage.
                Note: The confusion effect can be prevented by confusion
                resistance, and the stun effect by sound resistance.
Sound           Sound attacks do less damage but can stun you or even knock
                you out so you will die as if you were paralyzed. Free Action
                won't help you then.
                Resistance will cut damage to 5/7..5/12.
                Damage is reduced by further 50% if bio-feedback is active.
                (Bio-feedback is activated if a Draconian eats a firestone and
                gets the 'adrenaline' message. See (5.9) for firestone
                details.)
                Sound resistance will protect you from stunning effects.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Sound breath caps at 400.
                (Monsters that have the NO_STUN flag will resist somewhat and
                suffer less damage.)
Shards          Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Damage is reduced by further 50% if bio-feedback is active.
                (Bio-feedback is activated if a Draconian eats a firestone and
                gets the 'adrenaline' message. See (5.9) for firestone
                details.)
                Shard resistance will protect you from cuts. If you don't have
                it you might get nasty cuts that make you bleed over time.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Shard breath caps at 400.
Nexus           Nexus attacks can have extremely nasty side-effects if you
                don't resist them. Those are
                -Teleport you randomly.
                -Teleport you towards the monster.
                -Teleport you a dungeon level higher or lower.
                -Swap two of your six stats randomly!
                 ("Your body starts to scramble")
                 This change is permanent and there is no remedy against it
                 except for getting hit by more nexus deliberately and hoping
                 for a 'good' scramble result eventually.
                -Destroy items in your inventory.
                 ("Your backpack starts to scramble")
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3. Nexus breath caps at 250.
Chaos           Chaos attacks can also have nasty side-effects if you don't
                resist. These are:
                -Confuse you.
                -Let you hallucinate.
                -Drain some experience. Resisting 'Nether' will also prevent
                 this. Having 'Hold Life' will also provide some protection
                 against life draining.
                Resisting chaos will also make you resist confusion attacks.
                Resisting chaos will prevent hallucination from certain mind
                blast attacks.
                Resistance will cut down damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Chaos breath caps at 600.
                Raw chaos invocation (chaos ball) does (level*4)+(10d10) dam.
Light           Light effects can blind you if you don't resist it.
                Resistance will cut damage to 4/7..4/12.
                If you are mimicking a monster that is susceptible to light
                you will suffer double damage from attacks.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Light breath caps at 400.
Darkness        Darkness effects can blind you if you don't resist it.
                Resistance will cut damage to 4/7..4/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Darkness breath caps at 400.
                Darkness Storms (balls) do (level*5)+(10d10) damage.
Nether          Nether is kind of 'the element of undead' - most higher level
                undead creatures will have a nether attack of some sort.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12 and prevent all life
                draining (experience loss) from nether attacks.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Nether breath caps at 550.
                Nether bolts do 30+(5d5)+(level*3/2) damage.
                Nether balls do 50+(level*4)+(10d10) damage.
                If you lack nether resistance, having 'Hold Life' ability can
                at least offers some protection from experience loss.
Disenchantment  This attack does massive damage and can also disenchant your
                equipped items, lowering their to-hit/to-dam/to-ac bonus!
                It can also destroy ethereal ammunition.
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12 and prevent
                disenchantment of your equipment.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6, it caps at 500.
                Disenchantment bolts do 25+(4d5)+(level*3/2) damage.
                If disenchantment hits items on the floor, it can even reduce
                their magical (+X) pval bonus.
                Artifacts have a chance to resist disenchantment.


Irresistible/extremely powerful damage types:
---------------------------------------------
Force           Pure force impact (BR_WALL). Raw damage is monster HP/6.
                Force impact (breath only) is capped at 200 and irresistible.
                If you lack sound resistance you will get stunned.
Inertia         Inertia attacks will slow you down a lot. There is no 'Inertia
                resistance' but 'Free Action' will slightly reduce the
                slowdown duration.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/6 and caps at 200.
Gravity         These attacks have very annoying side-effects:
                -Teleport you randomly.
                -Slow you down.
                -Stun you if you don't resist sound.
                It's impossible to resist gravitation. However, having
                'Feather Falling' will reduce the damage your body takes from
                being thrown around by the shockwave and hence cut the damage
                to 6/7..6/12.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/3 and caps at 150.
Mana            Mana is pure magical energy. There are only rumours
                about items that provide resistance against it.
                Resisting it will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3, breath caps at 250. Only very
                few monsters (mostly uniques) can breathe mana.
                Mana bolts do 50+(1...[level*7/2]) damage.
                Mana storms (balls) do (level*5)+(10d10) damage. Beware!
Time            Time is pure temporary distortion. There are only rumours
                about items that provide resistance against it.
                Time attacks can have very nasty side effects:
                -Drain experience (Hold Life won't help).
                -One of your stats can be lowered (resistance will reduce the
                 amount; for runespell backlash damage in particular resistance
                 will even prevent all drain effects completely).
                -Drain all your stats (resistance will prevent this).
                Resistance will cut damage to 6/7..6/12.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3. Time breath caps at 150.
Meteor          This is an irresistible attack of pure impact.
                Sound resistance will prevent stun effect.
Disintegration  This is an irresistible attack of raw destruction.
                Damage (breath only) is monster HP/3, capping at 300.


Combined damage types:
----------------------
Ice             Ice attacks combine shard and cold damage.
                Ice damage (bolt only) is (6d6)+monsterlevel.
                Ice damage consists of 60% cold damage and 40% shards damage.
Plasma          Plasma attacks combine raw force, electricity and, mostly of
                all, immense heat. The usual resistances, susceptibilities
                and immunities for fire, electricity and sound apply as
                available.
                Plasma also has stun effect if sound resistance is missing.
                Breath damage is monster HP/6. Plasma breath caps at 150.
                Plasma bolts do 10+level+(8d7) damage.
Radiation/Nuke/ This is a poisonous attack (player suffers pure poison damage)
 Toxic Waste    that may have acidic effect on your inventory (inventory may
                get destroyed as if you were hit by acidic attacks).
                If you resist poison
                - you will just take 2/5 of the damage
                - you will be protected from being poisoned
                - your equipment will be safe from acidic damage.
                Breath damage is monster HP/3 and caps at 800.
                Nuke balls (radiation balls) do (level*3)+(10d6) damage.
Rocket          Rockets combine fire, shard & sound effects and can also damage
                your inventory. Rockets do insane damage if unresisted:
                Rocket damage is monster MaxHP/4, it caps at 800.
                Shard and sound resistance will lower damage by 1/6 each,
                fire resistance will lower damage by 1/5, fire immunity by
                1/4 (overriding fire resistance). These reductions stack (as in
                they are consecutively applied to the damage).
                Shard resistance will prevent cuts, sound resistance will
                prevent getting stunned.
                (Technically, rockets are similar to breath attacks.)
Detonation      Same as rocket.
Inferno         Same as detonation, except it does not destroy walls.
Havoc           A terrible mixture of wrecking Inferno, blasts of uncontrolled
                mana and waves of raw chaos.

There is also a special 'Teleportation Resistance', giving the self-knowledge
line: "You resist incoming teleportation effects.".
Having this will give the character a good chance to not be affected by most
teleportation effects from traps or monsters (teleport-away and teleport-to).
Nexus-related teleportation is also affected by this, gravity however is not.


Immunities
----------
Players can become immune to the basic elements and poison by wearing
items (for example dragon scale mails of the corresponding colour) or by
transforming into a monster shape that carries the according immunities
(see (6.7) about mimicry details).
If a player is immune to an element, (s)he won't take any damage from those
attacks nor be affected by any side-effects.
Example: Wearing the unique cape 'Ocean Soul' which as a special feature
provides water immunity makes the player take 0 damage from a water bolt attack
and also protect him from the stun+confuse effect of water bolts.
(It won't protect him from the stun/confuse effect of other types of attacks
though, for example a sound or confusion breath.)


Susceptibilities
----------------
Some monsters and players are susceptible against certain elements. For example
fire hounds are susceptible against cold attacks and Ents are susceptible
against fire attacks.

Branded physical attacks vs monsters:
Susceptibility of a monster will result in a doubled multiplier for
branded attacks. Example: If the player hits a Cold Hound with a
fiery broad sword (2d6) the Cold Hound will receive 2d6 * 4 damage
instead of 2d6 * 2 (usual brand multiplier for melee weapons).
Also see (5.3) for a table of brand multipliers.

Magical attacks vs monsters:
Susceptibility of a monster will result in double damage for the
according elemental attacks (ie cold ball vs fire hounds).

Magical attacks vs players:
If a susceptible player without resistance or immunity is hit by the according
elemental damage type, the damage will be doubled! The susceptibility is
applied after the global magical damage cap of 1600, so the player could in
theory take up to 3200 damage.

Branded melee attacks vs players:
Some monsters attack with elemental-branded melee attacks. These are treated
depending on the attack method, see (5.12a): The attack method will determine
how much of the damage is treated as elemental part and how much is physical
part. The elemental part will accordingly be doubled if the player is
susceptible to it.

Having both resistance and susceptibility to an element:
Resistance or immunity will not just cancel out the according susceptibility
but actually undo it. That means you will not take more damage on a character
that has both, susceptibility and resistance to an element than on a character
that has just the resistance but is not actually susceptible.

So one of the first things to do as an Ent is to visit the magic store and buy
a ring of fire resistance, or any druid ego monster or later on arch-vile will
give you a hard time.

(Branded physical attacks in pvp are not influenced by susceptibilities.
Also see (5.12) for details about melee attacks and melee damage caps.)



(5.7) Qualitative classification of items, identifying & selling items
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items are classified by
-a basic item type
-a simple magical enchantment (to hit-chance, to damage, to armour class)
-an ego power (some items even have two ego powers at once),
 (some examples: resistances on armours, elemental brands on weapons,
 enhanced brightness on light sources. The item carries the names of its
 ego powers. For example an 'Acidic Long Sword of Gondolin' has been
 blessed with two ego powers: 'Acidic' and 'Gondolin'. For more information
 about ego powers see (7.4) Spoiler Files).
-sometimes you may find an artifact which can have quite a bunch of
 different powers combined! Artifacts can be recognized by them carrying
 a name. Example: The War Maul 'Turmil' or The Whip of Gothmog.
 (See (5.9b) for more information about artifacts.)

If you find an item, it's 'unidentified'. That means you see only the
basic item type.
Example:
A Whip {+,?} (1d6)
The ? indicates that you don't know yet which level is required to wield
this item. You have to identify the item to find out more about it.
(The (1d6) means that this weapon has one 6-sided die rolled to determine
its damage afflicted to your target.)

Assuming you identify it you could get one of the results below:

Example 1:
A Whip {+,1} (1d6) (+0,+3)
This is a magical whip. Magical, because its damage is enchanted to +3.
It doesn't possess any further special abilities.

Example 2:
A Fiery Whip of Gondolin {+,24} (1d6) (+8,+11) (+3)
This is an ego-weapon ('of Gondolin') with a fire brand ('Fiery'). The
base weapon type is a whip which makes it belong to the blunt weapons.
Its to-hit and to-damage are magically enchanted to +8 and +11.
Gondolin weapons increase strength and constitution (here +3).

Ego-items or excellent magical items often have varying abilities.
For example a Gondolin-weapon _can_ have HOLD_LIFE, a high resistance,
or increase your dex. It doesn't _have to_, however. Some Gondolin-Weapons
have different abilities than others. To find out the complete powers of an
item it can be neccessary to *identify* it.
*Identify* (same as *Perception*) reveals the complete ability list.
You can check the complete list of any item listed in a store by pressing 'x'
to 'Examine an item'. For items in your inventory or equipment it is the 'I'
key instead. To get a full list of an items magical abilities outside of stores
requires that you already *identified* the item or bought it from a shop.
Items that are bought from a shop are always automatically *identified*.
Some shops offer an *identify* service but they are quite expensive.

If you want to look up what certain special items can/cannot do, see the
spoiler files section (7.4) or further explanations in (5.8) and (5.9).

If you sell an item to a shop the offer you will receive depends on
the following:

Item is not identified at all -> the offered cash will equal the value of the
                                 basic item type, eg 300 Au for a long sword
                                 or 20 Au for an unknown potion.

Item has been pseudo-identified -> shops won't buy items that have a bad
                                   pseudo-identification. 'average' items will
                                   sell for the value of the basic item type.
                                   good/excellent/special items will sell for
                                   their basic value too so you better
                                   identify them to get more money for them!

Item has been identified -> the shop will pay you fully for all those boni
                            that are either very obvious (like +STRength or
                            Extra Attacks or Life/Mana) or which are always
                            granted to this kind of ego item (for example
                            'weapons of *Slay Evil*' always give 'ESP evil').

                            However, the shop won't offer money for 'hidden'
                            abilities like resistances or ESP which aren't
                            obvious and which are randomly bestowed upon
                            this type of ego item. (Most ego items have
                            one or more random powers!)
                            To make the shop pay for these unknown powers
                            too you'll need to fully identify the item,
                            this is called *identifying* (note the asterisks).
                            To do this, there are scrolls of *Identify*,
                            staves of *Perception* as well as the spell
                            'Greater Identify'.
                            If your item turns out to lack any hidden powers
                            you wasted the *Identify* scroll, but that's not
                            a big deal.

Item has been identified and is a true artifact -> the shop will pay a fixed
                                                   price which is predefined
                                                   for each true artifact.
                                                   You don't need to *ID* it.
                                                   Note that you can actually
                                                   look up all true artifacts
                                                   by pressing:  ~ 6

Item has been identified and is a randart -> Shops will usually offer between
                                             10,000 and 15,000 Au for unknown
                                             randarts, but never more than the
                                             item is really worth. You should
                                             _always_ *identify* your randarts
                                             to discover all their hidden
                                             abilities, so shopkeepers will
                                             pay a lot more.

Item has been identified and is cursed -> the shops never buy cursed items.
                                          That might change if you uncurse
                                          it and if the item hasn't only bad
                                          (negative) boni on it.

Shop prices in general may slightly vary depending on the shop owner's race
and your character's race.

Sometimes an item turns out to be an artifact!
See (5.9b) for more information about artifacts.

If a player holds an unidentified item long enough he/she might get
a 'feeling' about it. The more points in 'Combat' skill the player has
the faster and clearer he can feel the items value. This is called
'pseudo-identifying'. Warriors are more likely to pseudo-id than casters.
If a player pseudo-ids an item, the 'feeling' will be appended in { }
brackets to the item name.
Note that archers or casters will also become better at pseudo-id'ing,
if they train the 'Archery' or 'Magic' skill respectively.
'Archery' at level 11 helps to get more detailed ('excellent' too instead of
just 'good') feelings about ranged weapons and ammunition.
'Magic' at level 11 helps to get more detailed ('excellent' too, instead of
just 'good') feelings about magic items, potions and scrolls.

Items display the following pseudo-id tags:

-Basic items, non-magical:      {average}
-Magically enchanted items      {good}
-Excellent magical items        {excellent}
-Artifacts (random & static)    {special}
-Cursed items                   {cursed}
-Useless items (often cursed)   {worthless}
-Useless items (not cursed)     {broken}
-Cursed artifacts / egos        {terrible}

('worthless' and 'broken' sort of overlap, depending on item base type.
For example rods without value will be worthless instead of broken, while
armour will be broken, and ego armour without value will be worthless again.)

Terrible doesn't need to equal useless. Some cursed artifacts can be very
powerful, rings of power dropped by Nazgul especially.

Note that potions don't have 'egos' or 'artifacts', scrolls don't have
artifacts either, but some of the potions and scrolls show similar pseudo-id
tags.

Again - if you want to look up what certain special items can/cannot do, see
the spoiler files section (7.4) or further explanations in (5.8) and (5.9).


(5.7a) Types of Identification
------------------------------
There are different stages and types of identification:
a) pseudo-indentification.
   This gives you one of the basic feelings like {good}, described above.
b) identification via ID (eg by scroll, staff or shop service - or from trying
   to use the item, if your character is able to observe any result, in which
   case it might yield some experience even):
   This actually does two types of identification!
   1) It identifies the magical properties of an item, such as
      +hit, +damage, +ac, names of ego powers or artifact power.
      These values are then seen by any player who looks at the item after
      it has been identified.
   2) It identifies the flavour of an item (if it is a flavoured item) for
      the particular player who identifies it.
      Flavours are prefixes in the base item name, in particular:
      -potion colours
      -scroll titles
      -ring/amulet materials
      -magic device materials
      So if you identify a 'clear potion' you will get to know that it's a
      'clear potion of water'. However, this flavour is now only know to you.
      Other characters who have not yet identified a clear potion on their own
      will still not know that it's a 'clear potion of water'.
c) identification via *ID* (eg by scroll, staff or shop service):
   This is the same as ID but additionally reveals all details of all ego- or
   artifact powers the item has.
   This can lead to an increase in price if some of those powers were not
   considered obvious, in which case stores wouldn't pay for them when you sell
   the item. Non-obvious powers are those that are randomly occurring (those
   don't exist on true artifacts).

Note: There are certain effects that can make your character lose his knowledge
      of items, which corresponds to 'unindentification' of types a) and b)1)
      and also loses the additional knowledge gained from c) in the list above.
      The flavour knowledge as described in b)2) is always preserved though.


(5.7b) The EASY_KNOW flag
-------------------------
Items that do not have any random mods, enchantments or abilities on their base
version possess the EASY_KNOW flag.
This flag means that the item will not need to be identified if it doesn't have
any special powers (ego powers/artifact). Example:

Most items don't have EASY_KNOW flag and look like this when you find them:
Dagger {+,?}    <- the question mark, hiding its level requirements, indicates
                   that you don't know if it's got special powers or not,
                   until you identify it.

Light sources are among those items that have EASY_KNOW flag and when you find
one it will look like either one of these:
Brass Lantern {+,3}   <- you know right away that this lantern has NO special
                         powers, because it shows the level requirements.
Brass Lantern {+,?}   <- you know right away that this one MUST have special
                         powers, because it masks the level requirements.

So whenever you find a light source with '?' for level requirements, make sure
to pick it up and identify it, it will have special powers!

More examples:
-Rings of Resist Fire have EASY_KNOW flag, because they cannot have any random
 properties.
-Rings of Protection do not have EASY_KNOW, because they come with a random +AC
 enchantment, so you need to identify it to find out.
-Why do Amulets of Anti-Teleportation come with '?' for level requirements,
 even though they do not have any enchantments or special powers? Because they
 have one: They can actually be cursed sometimes, this counts as random special
 power too!
-Note that shields have EASY_KNOW flag too, so make sure to pick up any shield
 that shows a '?' for level requirements, it might turn out very valuable.


(5.7c) Loot tables
------------------
Also called drop tables, specifying which type of items a monster might drop.
The type, level, quality and use-level of an item may depend on these factors:

-The level of the entity it is dropped by (monster or chest).
 Monsters have a loot table that you can review by pressing ~7. It knows five
 treasure classes: Treasure, combat, magic, tools, junk (see further below).

 Small chests have a higher chance of dropping gold instead of items, while
 larger chests drop more items than gold. Note that items found in chests have
 a high chance of being 'good' aka enchanted (same as DROP_GOOD monster flag).

 Monsters may have DROP_xxx flags that determine if they drop gold, items, how
 many of them, and whether the items have a higher chance to be enchanted or to
 possess ego powers or turn out to be an artifact than usual (those are the
 DROP_GOOD flag for enchantments and especially important the DROP_GREAT flag
 for it becoming and ego item or artifact - also see (5.11a) for some tips on
 hunting lower level monsters that have the DROP_GREAT flag).
 Note that unique monsters have a higher chance of dropping enchanted items
 (similar to the effect of the player having more 'Luck').

 A higher chance to turn out 'good' (by luck or by the DROP_GOOD flag or
 equivalent means as described above) will also carry over to become a somewhat
 higher chance to turn out 'great' (ego item or artifact), so for example
 unique monsters and chests don't just have an especially high chance to drop
 enchanted items but will also drop ego/artifact (great) items somewhat more
 often.

-The player's 'Digging' skill, for money mined from terrain features and for
 items discovered from mining - will affect potential item level and quality.
 Amount of gems mined and the level of items discovered will at the same time
 also depend on dungeon floor depth and get limited by it somewhat.

-The floor level (depth) and in the case of acquirement scrolls whether it's
 read on the world surface or not (reading it in a high-level town CAN produce
 the same results as reading it on a dungeon floor of similar level, but will
 not GRANT a high quality, which it does when you read it in a dungeon).

-The event type if it's a reward for some kind of event (for events other than
 extermination orders the use-level is usually zeroed, binding the item to your
 character so it cannot be traded).

-The player's 'winner' state (whether the player has beaten Morgoth or not) and
 the player's 'fallen winner' state (whether the player has died after having
 beaten Morgoth and hence lost the royal title).
 These states are used to determine whether an item is dropped that can only be
 used by winners (WINNERS_ONLY flag) or a random artifact being created
 receives +LIFE bonus (increases hit points) or not. LIFE bonus can also be
 influenced with '!L' inscription on Artifact Creation scrolls.
 The only WINNERS_ONLY items existing in the game are a couple of different
 types of royal armour which melee-oriented characters can utilize to improve
 their tankiness.

-The player's amount of 'Luck' for monster drops and items found by digging,
 see 'LUCK' in (5.8) for details. Luck will increase chances of those items to
 turn out good (enchanted) or even great (ego power or artifact) somewhat more
 often.

-The item's ego powers will increase the item's use-level. If it's an artifact
 it will influence the item's use-level depending on the predefined artifact
 level (for true artifacts) or the artifact's power (for random artifacts).

-The item base type in some special cases (the level may be tied to the
 item's power for certain types of items). For example the use-level of speed
 rings directly and only depends on their +SPEED bonus.

-Whether the item is stolen: Stealing a valuable item has a chance to
 set its level to zero, making it untradable. (There is always a chance for it
 to not get zero'ed though, keeping it tradable, even for the most expensive
 items.)


The most common case by far are items that are dropped by monsters when you
kill them. Neglecting the 'winner' state (that toggles WINNERS_ONLY items and
+LIFE randarts) for now, we are left with three factors which determine the
item that you will find on the floor:

1) The dungeon floor depth (aka dungeon level).
2) The monster race level (the level given in the ~7 monster lore. The actual
   monster level can be higher depending on the depth where you encounter it,
   since monsters get their level boosted if they appear on floors of much
   higher level than their race level).
3) The monster's treasure class table. Each monster type (race) has a table
   of percentage values for these five treasure types, which you can again see
   in the ~7 monster lore. The lore displays the first four classes, while the
   5th is 'hidden' and is the rest chance not covered by the first four:

    -Combat:
     Weapons, armour (except boots), shields, ammunition.

    -Treasure:
     Chests, rings, amulets, dragon scale mails, crowns.

    -Magic:
     Mage staves, wands, staves, rods, runes, potions, scrolls (except for
     golem command scrolls which fall under 'Junk' category), books,
     parchments.

    -Tools:
     Boots, cloaks, diggers, light sources, flints, food, flasks, trap kits,
     spikes, climbing sets, picklocks, money belts,
     devices of theft prevention, tarpaulins, mummy wrappings.

    -Junk (rest chance, not covered by the above four categories):
     Skeletons/skulls/bones, bottles, shards of pottery, broken sticks,
     firestones, all golem parts (massive pieces, arms, legs, command scrolls).
     Note: Monsters that don't have any treasure class at all are not set to
           100% junk, but can instead drop any item of all the five classes.

    Example: 'Green naga'.
    A Green naga has 25% chance of dropping 'Combat' loot and 65% chance of
    dropping 'Tools' loot. The remaining 10% chance translates to 'Junk' drops.

The formula for determining the item's level (the item base type level which
determines what kind of item you might get to see; not the actual use-level
that you will see on the item and that affects trading it between characters)
depends on the server configuration but is usually:

(dungeon floor depth + monster race level) / 2
to which (for each item anew) a random tolerance of 0..diff is added, where
'diff' is the difference of above's calculation result to the higher value of
the two 'dungeon floor depth' and 'monster race level'. 'diff' caps at 20.

Note that the highest level items in the game at this time are these two level
115 items: 'Massive Piece of Adamantite' and 'Heavy Ribbed Adamantite Armour'.


Example:

You kill a great wyrm of power on the deepest floor of Angband (-3050 ft), so
floor level is 127, race level is 85.
(floor + race) / 2 = (127 + 85) / 2 = 106.
Now the higher of the two (floor and race) is 127. The difference of the result
(106) to 127 is 21. This gets capped at 20 and is the random 'tolerance' for
each item dropped by the wyrm.
The treasure class of the wyrm is 50% treasure and 50% combat.

Let's look at 3 items it drops:

1) 106 + random(0..20) = 106. An unlucky tolerance roll added 0 to the level
   average.
   The item level 106 is still quite high though: The One Ring might actually
   drop since it's level 100 (provided we're not a winner yet, who cannot find
   true artifacts) or a power dragon scale mail (level 100 too) could drop as
   well.
   What cannot drop on this attempt is a Heavy Ribbed Mithril Armour, for
   example, because it is level 110 (see in k_info.txt spoiler file).

2) 106 + random(0..20) = 126. A lucky tolerance roll, we got the full 20 added
   to the level cap of the second item that the wyrm dropped.
   This means that this item could be anything that can possibly drop (from the
   treasure classes 'treasure' and 'combat' that is). So if we have beaten
   Morgoth and hence acquired a royal title, we might see any piece of royal
   armour drop.

3) 106 + random(0..20) = 114. The random tolerance roll of 0..20 turned out to
   be an 8 for this item, closely ruling out Heavy Ribbed Adamantite Armour
   which is level 115, but allowing all other items of the appropriate treasure
   classes of this monster.



(5.8) Special abilities of items
--------------------------------
FEATHER ('It makes you fall down gently like a feather.')
        'Feather Falling'.
        Lets you resist gravitation damage somewhat.
        Lets you float down gently if you accidentally stumble into pit-style
        traps.
        Enables you to cross 'dark pits' terrain type (see (4.4)).
LEVITATE
        ('It allows you to levitate.')
        Allows you to cross over water areas without drowning. Enables you to
        hover high enough to pass trees and bushes easily.
        Note that levitation automatically also gives feather falling, so see
        'FEATHER' above for further benefits granted by that ability.
XTRA_SHOTS
        ('It fires missiles excessively fast.')
        This ranged weapon can fire an extra shot per round, see your number of
        shots per round go up in 'C' character overview screen.
        For trap kits, the number of shots they fire can actually increase by
        more than one, depending on their pval (the number in parentheses, for
        example '(+2)' would fire 2 extra shots).
XTRA_MIGHT
        ('It fires missiles with extra might.')
        This ranged weapon fires more damaging shots: Its damage multiplier is
        increased by 1 above the usual multiplier for this weapon type.
        For example a Long Bow of Extra might would show a (x4) multiplier,
        although Long Bows usually have a (x3) multiplier.
        Note that the multiplier may also affect the maximum shooting range.
MANA ('It affects your mana capacity.')
        Will increase your total mana points by +x0%. Example:
        Gloves of the magi (+3) increase your mana by 30%.
        MANA items _add_ to each other, they aren't multiplied.
        MANA-increasing items have reduced effect on priests or paladins,
        because their spells are not so much pure magic but rather a form
        of praying.
        MANA affects your complete mana pool, including the additional MP
        (mana points) a character gained from 'Magic' skill.
LIFE ('It affects your hit points.')
        Will increase your total hit points by +x0%. Example:
        Sword of life (+2) increases your HP by 20%.
        LIFE items _add_ to each other, they aren't multiplied.
        The maximum total +LIFE bonus a character can achieve is +3 (cap).
        (For mimics, the +LIFE effect might be less since their HP in
        player form or monster form might be low. The +LIFE isn't applied
        to mimics' final HP but the lower base HP.)
        LIFE affects your complete hit point pool, including the additional
        HP a character gained from 'Health' skill.
        +LIFE on randarts will only affect player characters if they meet
        certain conditions, see server options in-game via ~d for details.
AGGRAVATE ('It aggravates nearby creatures.')
        Wakes up all monsters in whose radius of awareness you are.
        (Does not haste them as scrolls do, compare to (5.9)).
LUCK ('It affects your luck.')
        If you are lucky, your chance to find better items increases.
        Luck caps at 40, having higher bonus won't help any more.
        The higher your luck is, the more diminishing is the effect of
        increasing it even more.
        What does 'better items' mean exactly?
        It simply means that you have a higher chance to get good or great
        items when killing monsters or digging.
        'Good' means that an item has enchantments to hitchance, damage or
        armour class. How much exactly it has isn't affected by luck (well, it
        is by your personal ooc luck I guess :-p).
        'Great' means that an item has ego powers or is an artifact. Luck does
        not affect how great its ego power or artifact abilities will be!
        Note: Luck has NO effect on 'acquirement' and 'artifact creation'.
        Note: Luck does NOT affect which base item type drops, ie whether it is
        a dragon scale mail or a cloth hat.
NO_MAGIC ('Anti-magic shell')
        Raises your saving throw to 95%, making you nearly immune to any
        malicious magical influence (like paralysation or slowness, but also to
        monsters cursing you). Also prevents you from using any magic device or
        casting spells. You can still use scrolls and potions though.
        For more information about Saving Throw see (6.3).
ANTIMAGIC ('Anti-magic field')
        Prevents you from using any magic device or casting spells, also
        prevents nearby monsters and other players from casting spells (but
        not from using magic devices). You can still use scrolls and potions
        though.
        The field has less influence on _party members_ who try to cast.
        Usage of magic devices by party members is not hindered.
        The radius is approximately the field power / 9, and is cumulative
        to the 'Anti-magic' skill. The field power is the chance of
        suppressing a spell. It caps at 75% and is cumulative to the
        'Anti-magic' skill. Make sure to read up on anti-magic skill at (6.2).
        The chance to interrupt spells is quartered for your party members,
        so they are not affected much by your anti-magic field.
        The anti-magic field's radius caps at range 9.
BLESSED ('It has been blessed by the gods')
        These weapons resist cursing. Priests can use blessed weapons
        without penalties, even if they are not blunt. They will get their
        'Blunt-mastery' skill applied to any blessed weapon, even if it isn't
        actually blunt-type but a sword, axe or polearm instead.
VAMPIRIC ('It drains life from your foes')
        Drains life from your victim, which heals you slightly.
        For details see '(5.15) Vampirism'.
VORPAL ('Sharp' weapons, 'It is very sharp and can cut your foes.')
        Has a chance that the weapon damage dice result is multiplied on
        hitting, you'll see 'Your weapon cuts deep into your enemy'.
        Brand/slay effects will further increase the damage, if applicable.
        VORPAL requires an edged weapon, so swords, axes and several polearms
        can obtain 'VORPAL' mod via "Sharp" or "Spinning" ego power.
        Regarding randarts, only sword-type weapons are eligible.
        Note that Scythes of Slicing always come with VORPAL mod, be it as base
        item, ego item or even as randart.
SLAY_WEAP (No message, can spawn other mods/increase dice randomly.)
        A special mod for "Weapons of Slaying", see further down in (5.9).
CRIT    ('It affects your ability to score critical hits.')
        This item adds to your chance to score critical hits.
        If the item is a weapon then it will only affect hits done with this
        weapon in particular, so for example a boomerang that provides +CRIT
        bonus will not affect your melee attacks.
        If the item is not a weapon (eg a piece of armour or a ring) then it
        will affect all of your physical attacks, including throwing items.
        For more information about critical strikes and attacks, see the
        description of the "Critical-strike" skill in (6.2).
        CRIT requires light (up to 100 lbs) swords or polearms via "Perfection"
        ego power, but can also spawn on random artifact gloves and all types
        of random artifact weapons -including boomerangs- regardless of their
        weight.
CHAOTIC ('It produces chaotic effects.')
        On hitting, you have a 50% chance to do one of the following:
        a) drain life (VAMPIRIC, see (5.15)) (very likely).
        b) earthquake (see (5.13) for details).
           (If enabled in the server settings, it can be suppressed with
           the !E inscription. See (0.3) for !E settings or press ~d in game.
           Usually, !E only works on the artifact "Grond".)
        c) confuse target (very likely).
        d) teleport target away.
        e) polymorph target.
        f) clone target aka duplicate the monster it hits. Note that the clone
           does not give experience, drop items, or give form credit for
           mimicry users.
        Note that most of these have an *extremely* low chance to occur.
        Most of the time the vampirism or confusion effect is chosen.
CLONE ('It can clone monsters.')
        Has a 1 in 1000 chance to clone the monster it hits.
IMPACT ('It can cause earthquakes.')
        Causes earthquakes if the damage is > 50. See (5.13) for details about
        earthquakes.
        (If enabled in the server settings, it can be suppressed with
        the !E inscription. See (0.3) for !E settings or press ~d in game.
        Usually, !E only works on the artifact "Grond".)
FUEL_LITE ('It provides light when fueled.')
        A light source that needs to be fueled, otherwise it runs out.
        WARNING:
        If this item provides other abilities besides emitting light, be aware
        that you need to keep it fueled for it to do so! If it runs out of fuel
        your character will lose all abilities it provided until you refuel it.
CURSED, HEAVY_CURSE, PERMA_CURSE, AUTO_CURSE,
CURSE_NO_DROP, TY_CURSE, DG_CURSE
        See (5.14) Curses.
INVIS   ('It makes you invisible.')
        Turns you invisible. Items 'of y' often have a +mod,
        which gives you additional stealth. Note that this +mod does not
        qualify or affect your y in any way, but is purely for an
        extra stealth bonus. See '(5.16) y' for details.
BLOWS   ('It affects your attack speed.')
        This item adds EA (extra attacks) to your number of blows per round.
SH_ELEC ('It produces an electric aura.')
        Surrounds you with a lightning aura, damaging monsters each time they
        hit you in close combat.
SH_COLD ('It produces an icy aura.')
        Surrounds you with a frost aura, damaging monsters each time they
        hit you in close combat.
SH_FIRE ('It produces a fiery aura.')
        Surrounds you with a fire aura, damaging monsters each time they
        hit you in close combat.
REFLECT ('It reflects bolts and arrows.')
        Gives you a 75% chance to reflect shots, arrows, bolts and missiles
        fired at you, 45% chance to reflect magical bolt-type spells and 60%
        to deflect any physical projectile from traps you triggered.
        Reflected attacks will hit grids closely around their origin, possibly
        damaging/killing the monster who shot at you.

Weapons of Spinning
        On activatin spin around, hitting every monster around you in a
        radius of 1, with an extra stun effect.

EASY_USE (of Simplicity, 'It is especially easy to activate.')
        You have a much higher chance of succeeding to use the magic device.
        Also see (6.10) for more information about the 'Magic Device' skill.
CHARGING (of Charging) ('It regenerates its mana faster.')
        This magic device (rod) will take only 1/2 of the usual time to
        fully recharge.
'of the Istari' rods.
        Combination of EASY_USE and CHARGING.
'of Plenty' wands and staves.
        These have more charges than usual, and will also gain more charges
        from recharging than their normal counterparts. (See (5.21) about
        recharging.)

WINNERS_ONLY
        This item can only be equipped by winners (kings/queens/emperors/
        empresses) and fallen winners (those who lost their title because they
        died).
        This item can only be found by certain characters, see server options
        in-game via ~d for details.

(NO_SEED
        An ego item that is never created randomly (in terms of abilities
        or power) and that is a lesser type and therefore allowed to stack with
        other similar ego items. These types are currently:
        Cursed/indestructible rings,
        Fireproof/waterproof scrolls and books,
        Any type of ammunition.)
        Items with other (more powerful) ego powers than these listed above
        will not stack in your inventory even if the items are identical.
INSTA_ART
        This item always is an artifact; it has no base-class that can spawn
        non-art items. Example: Long Sword base class can spawn regular long
        swords, but also 'Elvagil'. A Phial however will instantly be
        'artified' and turn into Phial of Galadriel or Undeath. There are no
        base-type non-art phials in the game.
SPECIAL_GENE
        These artifacts are 'special artifacts' that cannot be dropped by
        regular monsters but require a certain key monster to be killed.
        For example the Dragonrider Coat of Mardra can only drop from Mardra
        (there is no guarantee that she will always drop it though).



(5.9) What does item xxx do exactly?
------------------------------------
Some items might look bad (Mushrooms of Unhealth), but keep in mind that you
can often throw ('v') these items to damage or impair an enemy.
For more information about items and especially ego items see (7.4).


Weapons & Armour
----------------
Blade of Chaos  Resists chaos and produces chaotic effects (see (5.8)).
Bluesteel Blade Cannot rust (not damaged by water attacks) and are especially
                sharp (see 'VORPAL' under (5.8)).
Dark Sword      Dark Swords have a so-called 'anti-magic field', which
                prevents the user from using magic devices or casting spells,
                and also has a chance to interrupt nearby monsters and players
                who try to cast spells but doesn't affect their magic devices.
                You can still use scrolls and potions though.
                The chance to interrupt spellcasters is 30% minus 3/5 of the
                to-hit and to-dam values of the dark sword. Example:
                A Dark Sword (+3,+7) has 30 - (3+7) * 3/5 = 24% chance of
                interrupting spellcasters. The chance is further quartered for
                party members, so they are hardly affected by your anti-magic
                field. Usage of magic devices by party members is not hindered.
                The radius of the anti-magic field is several fields (chance
                to interrupt spells, divided by 9), getting smaller if the
                chance is smaller than 30%.
                Dark Swords never give more than 30% AM, even if tohit and
                todam boni added together result in a negative number.
                They also never give 'negative anti-magic', 0% AM is the
                minimum, even if tohit+todam are greater than its AM.
                AC boni on Dark Swords won't affect the anti-magic field.
                The anti-magic chance and field radius of a dark sword stacks
                with the 'Anti-magic' skill (see (6.2)).

                Note that if you dual-wield dark swords the stronger AM field
                will override the weaker one, so they don't stack.

                Similarly, if there are multiple players around nearby who have
                anti-magic fields affecting the same monster then only the
                strongest AM field will work, overriding the weaker ones.
Demon Hammer    Slays demons.
Hunting Spear   Slays animals.
Mace of Disruption      Slays undead.
Scourge of Repentance   Slays undead.
Scythe of Slicing       Slays dragons and animals.
Shadow Blade    Resists darkness, cannot be damaged by acid or water, provides
                a fixed stealth bonus of +2.
Slaughter Axe   Slays animals.
Thunder Axe     Slays giants, provides lightning brand and resistance.

Weapons of Morgul       These are terribly cursed weapons that aren't good for
                        anything, just try to get rid of them. Since they have
                        a heavy curse on them, you need to either use a scroll
                        of *remove curse* or use enchant scrolls to break it.
                        For details about the enchant-scrolls trick, which is
                        usually much cheaper, see paragraph '(5.14) Curses'.
                        Wielding a weapon of Morgul will allow you to see the
                        invisible but also infect you with the Black Breath,
                        drain your experience and aggravate nearby monsters.
                        Note that this weapon can auto-recurse itself when you
                        move it between equipment and inventory, so when you
                        uncursed it drop it to the ground right away!
                        If you find a weapon of morgul, inscribe it '!w' to
                        prevent wielding it accidentally.
Weapons of Nothingness  Similarly terribly cursed as weapons of Morgul. You
                        are unable to strike while wielding this weapon.
                        Fortunately you can just drop or destroy these weapons
                        via 'd'/'k' keys just like any other items, right away.
                        See 'Weapons of Morgul' right above on how to break the
                        curse of this weapon to get rid of it.
                        Note that this weapon can auto-recurse itself when you
                        move it between equipment and inventory, so when you
                        uncursed it drop it to the ground right away!

Weapons of Slaying      These weapons can have greatly boosted damage dice
 (SLAY_WEAP)            and sometimes poison brand.
                        If it's a sword, axe or slice-type polearm it could
                        also get a 'vorpal' effect - see 'VORPAL' under (5.8).

Magic ammunition (Magic Arrows, Magic Bolts, Magic Shots).
                Those will return into your quiver magically, so just having
                one will already serve, as long as it isn't destroyed by some
                elemental attack..
                Artifact ammunition of any type auto-returns too, same as
                magic ammunition.
Silver ammunition       *Slays* undead.
Ethereal ammunition     Magically returns after being fired, has a small chance
                        to fade away instead though.

Blasted armour          Armour that has the prefix "blasted" has much less +AC
                        bonus than usual, in most cases the +AC value is deeply
                        in the negative numbers.
                        However, other than bad +AC the armour is not cursed or
                        impared in any way, and may still be usable, especially
                        if you use scrolls of enchant armour to 'repair' it.

Dragonrider Coat                Resists heat & cold.
Elven Cloak     Increases your stealth, searching ability and luck.
                For details about luck see LUCK flag in (5.8).
Elven Gloves    Regenerate hit points and mana points.
Multi-hued Dragon Scale Mail    Gives base + poison resistance (base means
                                fire/cold/lightning/acid) and two random
                                immunities out of those five.
                                For example one MHDSM might give fire and cold
                                immunity, while another MHDSM gives poison and
                                lightning immunity.
Royal Armour    Super-heavy armour that can only be worn by (fallen) winners,
                'winner' meaning queens, kings, empresses and emperors.
                (These armour pieces usually have a level requirement of 51 or
                more and can have special boni not found on other armour.)
                'Royal armour' is not a base item name itself but just
                describes various types of adamantite and mithril heavy armour
                or shields that will display
                "It is to be used by royalties exclusively."
                in violet colour when inspected/examined.
Serpent Scale Mail              Resists acid.
Shadow Cloak    Makes you hard to spot for other players, regarding
                a) them seeing you
                b) them being able to look at your current equipment.
                Shadow Cloaks work especially well to further disguise
                yourself while being invisible vs. someone who is able to see
                invisible creatures/players. See '(5.16) y'.

                Cures blindness, cuts, confusion, stun; heals 14d8 HP.
Curing          Heals some HP, removes blindness/confusion/stun, cures
                poison/cuts/hallucinations, heals some insanity,
                cures being gorged, restores all your stats (except exp).
Detonations / Death
                Better not drink it (or you deserve it).
                Also, handle with caution! Make sure those won't shatter in
                your backpack when you're hit by potion-damaging effects, or
                you might not see the next sunrise.
                If thrown (press 'v' to throw an item) these potions show the
                strongest effect by far of all potions - devastating!
                Accordingly useful to be used in fumes traps.
Enlightenment   Illuminates and maps the whole level and reveals all objects.
                It also identifies all of the user's items.
*Enlightenment* Raises your intelligence and wisdom, detect treasures,
                objects, secret doors, stairs, traps. Identifies all items.
                Tells you about yourself like a potion of Self-Knowledge.
Experience      Gives you additionally half your current experience plus 10,
                but only up to a maximum of +100,000 points. So you'll get the
                most out of it if you quaff it when you reached 200,000 exp.
                (Ok, 199,980 - thanks Sav...)
                However, some players prefer to quaff it earlier, when it's
                especially hard for them to reach the next level for some
                reason, maybe harder than if they were at 200,000 exp already.
Heroism         Temporary effects: Increase CHP and MHP by 10. Removes fear.
                +12 bonus to-hit.
Invulnerability Will turn you partially invulnerable (40% chance to fully
                deflect any attack, 50% damage reduction if it still hits) and
                increases armour class by 100 temporarily.
Learning        Gives you 1..3 (random) additional skill points to spend.
Life            Heals 700 HP, removes blindness/confusion/stun, cures
                poison/cuts/hallucinations, cures Black Breath,
                restores all your stats and experience.
Lose Memories   Lose 25% experience (if Hold Life is missing).
Resistance      Gives you temporary resistance against heat, cold, acid,
                electricity and poison. (Stacks with permanent resistance
                to lower the damage to 1/9 (1/3 temp * 1/3 perm)).
Speed           Temporary speed increase by +10.
Healing         Cures blindness, cuts, confusion, stun, poison; heals 300 HP.
*Healing*       Cures blindness, cuts, confusion, stun, poison; heals 700 HP.
Restore Life Levels
                Restores your experience, if it has been drained. You can see
                that your experience has been drained by it being displayed in
                yellow colour instead of the usual light green.
                Note that this potion does not restore experience you lost by
                dying (there is no way to restore experience loss by death).
Restore Mana    Restores 500 MP.
*Restore Mana*  Restores 1000 MP.
Ruination       Take 10d10 damage. All stats are decreased by 25 (restorable).
Self-Knowledge  Tells you everything about yourself and identifies your items.


Scrolls
-------
Acquirement     Gives you a great item, generated randomly (may sometimes be
                very great and sometimes less great).
                Reading it on deeper dungeon levels produces better results in
                general (although the outcome is still pretty random).
                Note that while some towns also have a high level, reading this
                scroll in town won't guarantee a 'great' item, which will
                be guaranteed if you read it in the dungeon.
                What you usually do: Either try to quickly visit a really deep
                dungeon level just to read the scroll, grab the item and get
                out of there. Or sell it to a town store for good cash.
                Acquirement is not affected by 'luck'.
                Acquirement does have a chance to produce artifacts.
*Acquirement*   Same as Acquirement, but gives you two or three great items.
Aggravate Monsters
                Wakes up all monsters within about twice the maximum sight
                range (a constant defaulting to 20, so aggrav. radius is ~40).
                Hastes all monsters in your line of sight (same as SHRIEK
                spell or traps of aggravation or the "/scream" command).
Blessing/Holy Chant/Holy Prayer
                Increases your AC by 8/14/20, also increases your to-hit
                bonus. (Temporarily)
Blood Bond      Inscribe this @P<playername>, for example @PGandalf, then read
                it to form a blood bond between you and that player. (Only one
                of you has to read a BB scroll, it's working bidirectional).
                Everyone on the server will receive messages about that blood
                bond been formed: "<player A> blood bonds with <player B>".
                If you don't see this message, you did something wrong. Get
                another scroll and repeat the blood bonding until you see the
                correct confirmation message.
                Your characters will automatically be hostile to each other,
                so you can fight in a friendly duel. This even works in town,
                which otherwise is a safe zone from PvP.
                The loser won't suffer a real death while blood-bonded, but
                just get teleported away. The hostility will automatically be
                cancelled when the blood bond ends or when a player logs out.
                Everyone on the server will be informed about the result:
                "<A> wins the blood bond against <B>".
Cancellation    Don't use it! It will heavily disenchant and blast all sorts of
                magic items in your inventory and render them worthless,
                including magic devices.
                Artifacts (and Stormbringer) are unaffected.
                Your equipment is unaffected.
Cheques         These are automatically generated in player stores when someone
                buys an item. They can be 'I'nspected to check their value or
                'r'ead to cash in the money.
                For more information see (4.10a).
Deeds           Some of the parchments are deeds, which are used as rewards
                for various purpose, such as events (see (4.13)) and
                PvP fights of PvP-mode-characters (see(6.13)).
                Press 'r' to read a deed, which will usually tell you what to
                do with it. In most cases, you have to turn it in at the
                mayor's office in Bree (one of the '+' doors in town).
*Destruction*   Causes a local earthquake, nearly completely wiping the area
                of monsters and objects (see (5.13) about earthquakes).
                Extremely powerful magic which causes a searing blast of light
                and a terrible shockwave that will blind you and knock you and
                everyone else out.
                Use this as a last resort!
                This magic will fail inside vaults and in towns or in the area
                surrounding a town within a radius of 3 worldmap sectors.
                It will also fail on dungeon floors that do not allow
                *destruction* magic explicitely (orange floor feeling saying
                "The walls here seem very solid.", also see (4.8)).
                (You do not get experience, loot or credit for monsters erased
                by *destruction*, same as for genocide-type spells.)
Enchant
  Sub-types: weapon to-dam, weapon to-hit, armour.
                Will attempt to enchant weapon/ammunition or armour.
                The higher the item is already enchanted the more unlikely it
                will succeed another time.
                The chance to succeed will also drop if the scroll is used on a
                stack of items, instead of a single item, depending on the
                stack size. It is easier to enchant a stack of ammunition than
                enchanting a same-size stack of regular weapons/armour though.
*Enchant*
  Sub-types: weapon, armour.
                Much more likely to enchant up to +15, and likely to enchant
                by several points at once.
                The chance to succeed will drop if the scroll is used on a
                stack of items, instead of a single item, depending on the
                stack size. It is easier to enchant a stack of ammunition than
                enchanting a same-size stack of regular weapons/armour though.
Fire/Ice/Chaos  Fires a ball of the according type around you. Make sure you
                resist it or you will take damage too.
Genocide        Removes all monsters of a certain kind from the current level.
                Drains your HP for each one removed.
                The race will be determined by the monster which stands
                closest to you when firing off the spell. For each monster you
                will suffer randomly from just 1 up to 4+(monsterlevel/8)
                points of damage, which cannot be absorbed by any magic shield
                or other protective effect!
                Depending on the server configuration, the caster's remaining
                hit points are usually halved (as an additional extra penalty)
                after the spell finished.
                Monsters have a chance to resist genocide, depending on their
                level. Monsters inside vaults, Uniques, and monsters that are
                immune to teleportation attacks cannot be genocided.
                (Genocide-type spells do not yield experience or loot.)
Golem Creation  Allows you to create a golem which follows you and which you
                can control to some extent, see (8.3) for more information.
Life            Resurrects another player's ghost if standing on a directly
                adjacent field to you when you read it. Does not work inside
                vaults, and only over solid ground.
                Also restores your experience points if they were drained.
                Since it was often asked: Non-everlasting and everlasting
                players can revive each other without problems.
Lottery         This might be your chance today to win the Jackpot!
                Just read it, if you win any money, it will appear under/around
                your character on the floor. You will always get a message that
                tells you if you won or not.
                A common question is if someone ever won the first prize and
                how much it is:
                Yes, several people have won it, although it happens extremely
                rarely. The prize at the time of writing this is about 1.5M Au.
Obliteration    Removes all monsters that are close to you.
                Drains your HP.
                All monsters within a radius (equal to your sight range)
                around you are annihilated. For each monster you will suffer
                between 1 and 3+(monsterlevel/8) points of damage, which cannot
                be absorbed by any magic shield or other protective effects!
                Depending on the server configuration, the caster's remaining
                hit points might be halved (extra penalty) after the spell
                finished (this penalty is enabled by default).
                Monsters have a chance to resist genocide, depending on their
                level. Monsters inside vaults, Uniques, and monsters that are
                immune to teleportation attacks cannot be genocided.
                (Genocide-type spells do not yield experience or loot.)
Parchments      These contain informations about the game, they won't
                disappear if you read them.
Protection from evil    Repels evil creatures that try to attack you in melee.
                        See the prayer 'Protection from evil' in (6.8)!
Recharging      Recharges a magical device (rod, wand or staff, see (5.21)).
Remove Curse    Breaks lesser curses on items, allowing you to unwear or
                destroy them. Note that many items can be sold for good cash
                as soon as they are uncursed!
                Also, non- or uncursed items that induce random teleportation
                can be inscribed .. to have the teleportation stop (compare
                (0.3 Important Inscriptions).
                (Scrolls give you the message:
                'You feel as if someone is watching over you.'.)
*Remove Curse*  Breaks heavy curses. Note that curses (including heavy ones)
                on weapons or armours can also be broken by enchanting one of
                their boni some points above +0 manually. (The enchant service
                of shops won't help!)
Rune of Protection  Creates a warding glyph on the floor that stops monsters
                    from crossing the field or summoning on it.
Rumour          Makes a random rumour come to your character's (and everyone
                else's characters') mind. Has no further effect and is not
                necessarily true even.
Wilderness Mapping  Maps the wilderness area around the worldmap sector you
                    are currently within. These scrolls also sometimes carry
                    an inscription telling the location of a hidden dungeon.
Word of Recall  Use it to quickly travel from the town or the wilderness into a
                dungeon or tower within your current sector.
                It can also be used to travel between towns or on the worldmap
                in general. See "(0.3) Important Inscriptions, Word of Recall"
                for more info about Word of Recall! ("Word of Recall", "WoR")
                Word of Recall scrolls can be exchanged between an everlasting
                and a non-everlasting player!
Vermin Control  Stops breeders on the map from multiplying. Doesn't have effect
                on certain non-natural breeders such as Unmakers.

Wonder          Wands of wonder cast random magic spells.


Jewelry
-------
Talisman (Amulet)       Increases your luck, helping you finding better loot.
                        (See LUCK flag in (5.8) for details about luck.)
Amulets of Adornment    They might be looking fancy, but they don't do
                        anything and have no effect on your character.
Amulet of Anti-Magic    See (5.8), 'NO_MAGIC'
Amulet of Anti-Teleportation    If worn it will suppress all attemps to
                                teleport, phase or recall the wearer,
                                regardless whether initiated by a monster or
                                by himself. It will also prevent certain
                                effects of unresisted nexus attacks.
Amulets of Brilliance   increase intelligence and wisdom, provide light.
Rings of Cunningness    increase strength and intelligence.
Rings of Might          increase strength and constitution.
Rings of Ready Wit      increase dexterity and intelligence.
Rings of Toughness      increase dexterity and constitution.
Rings of Sustain Ability        sustain strength and dexterity.
Rings of Sustain Brilliance     sustain intelligence and wisdom.
Rings of Sustain Cunningness    sustain strength, intelligence and charisma.
Rings of Sustain Might          sustain strength and constitution.
Rings of Sustain Ready Wit      sustain dexterity, intelligence and charisma.
Rings of Sustain Steadiness     sustain wisdom and constitution.
Amulets of Sustenance           sustain all six attributes, provide 'Hold Life'
                                aka resistance to experience-draining attacks,
                                and provide slow digestion.
                        Sustenance of a stat will prevent it from being drained
                        by various sort of attacks, potions, or other effects.
                        For most things it works 100% of the time, but for some
                        effects it just reduces the chance of a decrease to
                        occur.
                        Sustaining STR and DEX for example will ensure that you
                        don't lose attacks/round, so wearing a ring of Sustain
                        Ability can be helpful for melee fighters, especially
                        if they enter an ironman dungeon which they cannot
                        leave early in case they need to restore drained stats.
Elemental rings (flames, frost, acid, lightning)
                    Provide the according resistance and can be activated for
                    temporary resistance too, thereby temporarily giving you
                    "double resistance" (see (5.17) for details).
                    They also brand your physical attacks with the according
                    element.
Rings of Lordly Protection      Resist poison, disenchantment, life drain and
                                give free action (immunity to paralysis).
Amulet of the Moon      Gives infra-vision, the power to see invisible, and it
                        can be activated to sleep monsters nearby.
                        It also improves your +hit and +dam boni.
Rings/Amulets of Slow Digestion will slow your food digestion so you have to
                        eat less often. Also prevents instant paralysation if
                        your food state hits red 'weak'.
Amulet of Terken        Gives the power to see invisible, free action, and
                        improves your searching (usually by quite a lot).


Misc
--
Ale and wine        Will satisfy your hunger somewhat, and may have random side
                    effects:
                    Confusion, stun, hallucinations, 1 point of sanity damage,
                    paralysation, fear, blindness (methyl? ew), vomitting if
                    your stomach isn't relatively empty, temporary stat
                    decrease (except for strength), slowness,
                    heroism, berserk, speed.
                    Note that the unique dwarven ale of the Khazad is vastly
                    superiour to normal ale or wine, and will mostly affect the
                    drinker positively, not ever causing negative side effects
                    besides possible confusion.
Chests              Chests may contain treasures or items. Usually, chests
                    you find will have hidden traps on them. So what you do is
                    to hit 's' to search for traps while standing next to the
                    chest, or use any trap detection magic.
                    When you have discovered the trap, hit 'D' to disarm it,
                    or again use any sort of disarming magic.
                    The disarmed chest is finally safe to open with 'o' key.
                    Happy looting.
                    Note that only the chest's level affects what kind of items
                    you may find in it. It does not matter where you actually
                    are when you open it. A player's 'Luck' value has no effect
                    on what will come out of it either.
                    On average, large chests tend to contain items rather than
                    money while small chests mostly contain money.
                    Also see (5.7c) for more information.

Empty bottles       You can /fill these at fountains to turn them into
                    potions. (See (0.2b) for more details.)
(Small) Firestones  These can be eaten by Draconians and players in dragon
                    forms and have various random effects (small firestones
                    have reduced duration):
                    - If the player isn't a Draconian but he is currently in
                      dragon form he will get some mana refilled.
                    - If he is a Draconian, the following effects can apply:

                    If you eat too many of them over a short period of time you
                    might get poisoned by adrenaline overdose, with lethal
                    outcome.
Flint               Prevents your light from going out by automatically
                    refilling it right when it would've reached 0 turns.
                    For this to work you'll need to carry appropriate items in
                    your inventory that will be used up in the process, eg a
                    flask of oil or another lantern for refilling a lantern or
                    another torch for refilling a torch.
Fortune Cookie      Gives you a line of wisdom.

Dwarven lanterns    Make you resist fear. Don't need to be fueled.
Feanorian lamps     Make you resist fear and see the invisible. Don't need to
                    be fueled.
Lembas (elvish waybread)
                    Satisifies your hunger, cures poison and hallucinations.
Mattock/Pick/Shovel Diggers, improving your digging capabilities.
                    (+to-hit, +to-dam) on digging tools as well as a high
                    weight help to further increase their effectiveness.
                    Main factor is the (+diggingpower) mod though. (Equip it!)
                    If you lack any of these valuable digging tools, axes and
                    swords can help you hacking down trees or bushes. For
                    hacking away webs or ivy, certain polearms used for
                    slashing (scythes and sickles) may help too, just as much
                    as swords or axes. (see 'Digging' skill in (6.2) and (5.20)
                    for more information about digging).
Money Belt          When equipped, greatly reduces chance of thieves succeeding
                    in stealing your money.
Mushrooms of paranoia/cure paranoia
                    Cause/remove fear, cause/remove hallucinations.
Mushroom of Unmagic
                    Removes all magical effects from your body if eaten.
Mushroom of Restoring
                    Restores your stats and your experience if drained.
Mushrooms with bad effects are also often poisonous.
Mummy Wrapping      Reduces your charisma slightly, and prevents other players
                    from seeing your equipment except for your melee and/or
                    ranged weapon. Also makes you look dark like being
                    infected by Black Breath. (Equip it!)
                    Vampires start with a mummy wrapping, because it can
                    protect them from the sunlight. If they are moving on the
                    world surface (meaning not in a dungeon/tower) while it's
                    day, the sun will burn them if they don't resist light or
                    wear a mummy wrapping.
                    Hint: Polymorphing into a vampire bat may improve hit
                    point regeneration rate.
Picklock            When equipped, improves your trap-disarming ability.
Rubble ':' on the floor You can create sling ammo from this. You cannot pick
                        up rubble, just stand next to it (see (6.12)).
Skeletons/Bones/Skulls  You can craft ammunition from these if your Archery
                        skill is sufficient (see (6.12)).
Spell scroll        Although called "scrolls" they actually persist and can be
                    used infinite times. They may however get destroyed by
                    certain damage effects (most notably fire and acid)
                    same as regular scrolls. Spell scrolls ignore water damage
                    though, which can harm regular scrolls.
Spell crystal       They are like "spell scrolls", except they are used for
                    mindcrafter spells. A specialty of spell crystals is that
                    they ignore fire damage (and water damage, same as spell
                    scrolls).
Codex, Spellbook, Grimoire
                    These are magic books that may contain magic spells of any
                    type and school.
                    However, these books start out empty, devoid of any spells
                    and it's up to the player to add spells of his choice to
                    them.
                    To do so, he needs to find or buy spell scrolls in the
                    book store (orange '9' in town), then press 'A' to activate
                    the Codex, Spellbook or Grimoire, then choose the spell
                    scroll he wants to transcribe into the book. The scroll
                    will vanish and the spell will be permanently and
                    irreversibly added to the book.
                    Condition for this to work is that the book still has free
                    space left, and that the player has actually learned the
                    spell he wants to transcribe.
                    Codices can carry the least amount of spells (3),
                    spellbooks being intermediate (4), while Grimoires have
                    the most space (5).
                    (Note that you cannot use these books if your game client
                    version is below 4.4.2!)
Sprig of Athelas    Eat this one to cure Black Breath (see (1.3a) for more
                    information about Black Breath),
                    also cures poison/stun/cuts.
Tarpaulin           When equipped a tarp prevents your inventory and equipment
                    from taking water damage when crossing water fields or when
                    you are attacked with water-based effects.
                    Note that your weapon is not included in this protection
                    when you for example attack a water-based monster with it.


(5.9a) Activatable items
------------------------
Many items can be activated (press 'A' to try). These items are generally
called 'Magic Devices'. (Apart from these items, magic devices also include
wands, staves and rods, see (6.10) for more information.)

The chance of successful activation may or may not depend on various factors,
such as..
-your magic device ability vs the item type base level, your magic device
 ability consists mainly of your 'Magic Device' skill and also somewhat of your
 intelligence.
 See (6.10) for more information on the Magic Device skill.
-whether you have trained your Anti-magic skill
-if you have the item equipped

An activated item will usually have a cooldown (timeout) until it can be
activated again. Items that need to be equipped to be activated usually won't
recover while they aren't equipped.

Many artifacts can be activated, as well as items of certain ego powers. But
there are also some base item types that provide an activation effect.

Base and ego types that can be activated and aren't described elsewhere:

Cloaks of immolation: Temporary fire resistance.
Cloaks of frostweaving: Temporary frost resistance.
Cloaks of Lordly Resistanc: Temporary base+poison resistance.
Dragon Scale Mails: According breath attack.
Weapons of the Thunderlords: Teleportation.
Weapons of Spinning: Spin attack.
Fury weapons: Berserk.
Noldor caps: Treasure detection.
Spectral weapons: Wraithform (see (5.22)).

Serpent amulets: Poison breath.
Moon amulets: Sleep monsters.
Rage amulets: Berserk.
Elemental rings: Breath the ring element and temporary resistance to it.
Teleportation rings: Explode for teleportation.


(5.9b) Artifacts and artifact resets
------------------------------------
(For information about the 'timeout' on true artifacts, see 'Artifact resets'
further below.)

Artifacts of any type cannot be enchanted by any means, nor harmed by elemental
attacks of any type. Also they have a high chance to resist disenchantment
effects. (If the player actually resists disenchantment already then they are
completely safe.)

Artifact types in general
-------------------------
Some items are 'named', those possess especially great magic powers and are
also called 'Artifacts'.
Different from other items artifacts will pseudo-ID as 'special' (given
sufficient combat/magic/archery skill) or as 'terrible' if they are cursed.

The artifact name can either be given as a real name, for example:
    The Dagger 'Nimthanc'
or it can be in the form of a description like for example:
    The Whip of Gothmog
The 'The' indicates that this item is one of a kind, aka an artifact.

To find out all about the magic powers of an artifact it needs to be
*identified*, for example by a 'Scroll of *Identify*' or in one of the *ID*
shops that occur in most towns, which will usually cost around 2000..3000 gold.

Some artifacts can be 'A'ctivated for a special effect. This will be shown
in the list of its powers that you get when *identifying* it.

Artifact ammunition never breaks or (in case of boomerangs) falls down to the
floor instead of returning. Artifact weapons are harder to get disarmed.

There are two classes of artifacts, 'true artifacts' (also called 'static
artifacts') and 'random artifacts' or short 'randarts':


True artifacts
--------------
True artifacts are predefined in the a_info.txt file and will always sell for
their defined value even if they have not been *identified*.
You can search a list of all true artifacts in game, by pressing  ~ 6 .

True Artifacts are unique. If an artifact is owned by a player, noone else can
find it anymore until it's lost (for example if the player dies) or sold to a
shop, or if the player drops it to the floor and leaves it behind.
Depending on a server's configuration artifacts that are sold to shops usually
stay a while in the shop and can be bought by other players before they finally
disappear from the stock.

Usually true artifacts may not be dropped into a house (will just disappear!)
and may not be carried by winners, ie characters that have beaten Morgoth.
Since static artifacts are predefined and have fixed abilities, their number
therefore is limited. Thanks to the existence of random artifacts (see below)
this won't be able to cause any shortage of artifacts that can be found though.

Static artifacts will also be erased if they are left on the ground and the
dungeon level or worldmap sector gets 'unstaticed', that means it gets reset
because no players have been on it for a while (can be a few seconds for world
map sectors or dungeon floors that are left without any players on them, and up
to many hours in case someone ghost-died on a dungeon level, which can render
the dungeon level 'static' for that time to allow others to retrieve the loot).

Note that some cursed true artifacts can be sold to stores after you removed
the curse.


Random Artifacts
----------------
Random artifacts are composed randomly and even if they happen to bear the same
name might have totally different powers. Randarts need to be *identified* to
sell for what they are really worth.
Randarts can be dropped in houses and used by anyone just fine, with the
exception that randarts that give a hit point bonus can only be found/created
by winners (characters that have beaten Morgoth), and that the hit point bonus
will not apply if a non-winner character happens to use them.

As was just mentioned, randarts can actually be created by players, using a
'Scroll of Artifact Creation' which are somewhat often sold in the 'Expensive
Black Market' in Minas Anor, but also may very rarely spawn in normal black
markets.
The advantage of creating an artifact is that the player can determine the base
item type he wants to use. For more information about artifact creation see
(8.4).

Note that randarts that don't auto-curse themselves can be sold after you
removed the curse (except if the base item type is already worthless).


Artifacts vs Nazgul
-------------------
Artifacts greatly resist Nazgul, which cause most other weapons to break more
or less instantly. So even if an artifact weapon you find seems not very
appealing in particular you might want to keep it just for slaying Nazgul.
(See (1.3a) for more information about Nazgul.)

Note: 'The Stormbringer' is not a real artifact but it will show the same
resilience as true artifacts and random artifacts vs Nazgul.


Bonus from wearing similarly named artifacts
--------------------------------------------
If you wear/wield multiple artifacts of similar name, you will receive a luck
bonus (see (5.8), 'LUCK', for details about luck). For example if you equip
    The Whip of Gothmog    (which happens to be a true artifact)
and also
    The Hard Leather Armor 'Gothmog'    (which is actually a random artifact)
You'd get a small luck bonus, or 'set bonus'. The more artifacts of similar
name you equip the greater the luck bonus will be.
The exact luck boni for those 'artifact sets' starting at two items are:

  Number of artifacts equipped  |  Luck bonus
  ------------------------------+-------------
                    2           |    + 3
                    3           |    + 6
                    4           |    +10
                    5           |    +15
                    6           |    +21
                    7           |    +28
                    8           |    +36
                    9 or more   |    +40 (cap)

..which is actually the sum of all numbers from 1 up to the number of artifacts
you have equipped. Eg 2 artifacts -> 1+2 = 3. 4 artifacts -> 1+2+3+4 = 10.

Multiple equipped sets don't stack, only the biggest set counts!


Artifact resets
---------------
The old system of resetting all true artifacts at once every 3 months has been
replaced by a new "fluent" reset system:

Artifacts will last for 5 weeks after they have been found (ie dropped by a
monster/chest/just being generated on the dungeon floor, and picked up by a
player), after which they will "time out" and disappear. This timer is specific
for each single true artifact, depending on when it is found (again).

No compensation is given when an artifact times out and disappears, since that
would encourage hoarding, so sell an artifact to a store in time before it
actually vanishes.

To check the timeout of an artifact, inspect it ('I' to inspect).
For your character to 100% "know" if an artifact is a true artifact or not it
needs to *Identify* the item. So this will be required to see the timer on it.

The timer will also continue to run out while the owner/carrier of an artifact
is offline.
Trading artifacts between characters has no effect on the timeout.

Grond and Morgoth's crown do not time out.

Artifacts that can only be found by winners (kings/queens/emperors/empresses)
have twice the timeout delay (10 weeks).

All artifact timeout delays are further doubled on the Ironman server (5 weeks
for regular true artifacts, 20 weeks for winners-only true artifacts).

The Ring of Phasing has no timeout (!) but will instead immediately reset when
someone else kills Zu-Aon. Until then its owner can keep it indefinitely.



(5.10) Destruction of items by elemental attacks
------------------------------------------------
Items in your inventory can be destroyed if you are hit by an elemental
attack. Those attacks even have a very slim chance of destroying an item
that you have equipped!

In order for an item to guaranteedly survive such an attack, you must either
be immune or double-resisting (have permanent AND temporary resistance, also
see (5.17)) to that specific element. Double resistance is nearly as good as
immunity in regard to item protection.
Some items have IGNORE_xxx flags which let them ignore certain elements,
preventing them from being destroyed.
All artifacts, random and static ones, cannot be harmed by elemental attacks
of any type.

Here is a table of items and which elements they are susceptible against:
"Impact" happens if you fall into a pit, smashing some potions on hitting the
floor. Items that IGNORE_COLD also resist impact damage.
Usually items that contain wood, leather or stuff are susceptible to fire and
acid, while things that consist only of metal are just susceptible to acid.

*Impact-based attacks:
These do not hurt items in your inventory. For example impact hounds breathing
at you will not destroy any potions in your backpack.
However, there are some cases where impact-type destruction can happen to your
inventory items:
1) Falling through a trap door/chasm without having 'Feather Falling'.
2) Rocket attacks, if you do not resist both, shards AND sound!
3) Inferno/detonation damage, if you do not resist both, shards and sound.
   However, inferno and detonation damage cannot be caused by monsters.

Items ignore certain elements if they have the according resistance due to ego
powers, for example a leather shield of resist fire will ignore fire.

Some tomes or spellbooks will resist certain elements, for example a
Tome of the Eternal Flame cannot be harmed by fire.


(5.10a) Equipment damage from elemental attacks
-----------------------------------------------
Armour can get damaged when an elemental monster attacks you or when you get
hit by elemental magic. Blocking an attack with a shield may damage it in the
same manner. Weapons may take damage if you hit an elemental monster with them.
Armour might also rust from moving through water without a tarpaulin equipped.

Armour/shields getting damage means a reduction of their +AC bonus by 1 point
each time, while weapons getting damaged means a reduction of their +damage
bonus by 1 point each time.
AC bonus won't drop lower than half the negative amount of the base AC.
Damage bonus won't drop lower than -10.

If the player has resistance to the element, this will cut down the probability
of any equipment damage. Having double resistance (permanent + temporary) will
cut it down even further.
To completely prevent any equipment damage, you need to become immune to the
element, or the equipped item needs to ignore or resist the element.

The following table lists the elemental damage taken by various item types.

(5.11) Monsters
---------------
All creatures in the game apart from special 'questors' and other player
characters are actually "monsters", aka your enemies. Some might exhibit rather
neutral looking movement or no movement at all, some might not even inflict
damage, but none of them is friendly towards you and all of them will or in
some way or another make your survival more difficult.
Right after creating a new character you will already encounter "monsters" of
some sort: Townspeople, denoted by the letter 't' and maybe some cats, birds or
fish (if you happen to walk nearby the lake).
Since all creatures are basically hostile, you will auto-attack them when you
move onto an adjacent grid. Killing townies is a good way to make some easy
money. Just beware of mean-looking mercenaries and battle-scarred veterans.

When you enter the training tower or the dungeon you will soon notice the
variety of monsters, for example you will probably encounter a "floating eye",
denoted by an orange 'e'. These cannot inflict any damage on you but if you get
too close they will gaze at you which will in most cases paralyze you!
If you're unlucky or your Saving Throw stat (Shift+C to check) isn't
particularly great a floating eye might even lock you in paralyzation forever,
making you easy prey for any other monster around.

To check monster information you have three ways:
Press ~2 for monsters you have killed or ~3 for a list of 'unique' monsters.
Press ~7 for the 'monster lore' search. It contains all monsters in the game
 execpt for ego-variations (see below).

There are three types of monsters:
-Basic monsters (over 1100 of those), such as "a Hill Orc" or "a Zog".
-Unique monsters (over 200), such as "Azog, King of the Uruk-Hai".
  You can recognize these by distinctly flickering (like a colour 'spike').
-Ego monsters (over 50). These are not actually monsters but modifications of
  basic monsters, for example:
  The basic monster "Hill Orc" receives the ego-power "Archer", it will become
  "a Hill Orc Archer" and instead of trying to punch you in the face will shoot
  arrows at you.
  Ego monsters can also be recognized by flickering: They receive the ego-power
  colour in addition to their base colour. For above's example that would be
  the green base colour of the hill orc and the orange colour of "Archer"
  ego-power resulting in a green orc that flickers orange.
  If the ego-power colour is actually the same as the basic monster colour the
  resulting ego monster will instead flicker in random colour spikes just like
  unique monsters do.

Some ego monsters can be extremely nasty at low and mid levels. Among the most
feared are probably the (dark-brown) melee-specific egos "Monk", "Warrior" and
"Unbeliever" and the somewhat less bad "Chieftain" and "Possessed" animals as
well as the dark-green "Archpriest" ego which moves fast, has a powerful curse
attack and can summon more monsters.

Monsters have specific loot tables, a base level (r-level, racial level of the
basic monster type in general) and an actual monster level (m-level, the real
level of a monster standing before you, which can be above its basic r-level,
because monsters can appear as levelled-up versions if you encounter them on
much deeper dungeon levels than where they usually start to appear).
See (5.7c) for loot tables, see (0.4) for details on m-level and r-level.

Some unique monsters are "dungeon bosses", which means they can only be found
on the final level of a particular dungeon and when you kill them you will
"conquer" that dungeon (press ~8 to check your dungeon info). See (4.5d) for
info about dungeon bosses.

Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness is the game boss. To actually encounter him you
first need to defeat Sauron, the Sorceror though. See (1.3b) for details.
By defeating Morgoth the player is awarded royal status. There will be two
more dungeons that can only be entered by royalty and offer further, insanely
hard challenges and new unique bosses.


(5.11a) Monster flags
---------------------
Most monster flags you find in the spoiler files (press ~7 in-game or open the
actual file r_info.txt with a text editor or use Mikael's monster search) are
self-explanatory. Here is an explanation of some flags that are important but
might not be obvious:

FORCE_MAXHP     The monster always gets rolled at maximum hit points.
                For example if the monster has 3d6 hit points aka 3 dice with
                6 sides each, it could have anything between 3 and 18 hp.
                But if it has this flag, when you encounter this type of
                monster it will always have 18 hp.
FORCE_DEPTH     You cannot meet this monster out of depth. It will never appear
                on a floor of lesser level that itself.
FORCE_SLEEP     Deprecated, has no actual effect in-game.
                A note about monster sleep in general: Check monster lore (~7)
                to see which monsters start out asleep and which are awake.
                Note that monsters inside a pit (see (4.6)) are never asleep.
OOD_xx          The monster cannot occur more than xx levels out of depth.
                All unique monsters actually have an intrinsic OOD_20 flag even
                if it's not shown in the monster lore spoilers.
FRIENDS         This monster comes in a pack. Makes life easier for mimics.

RAND_xxx        This monster has random movement. The xxx number is the chance
                in percent. Several of these flags will stack.
NO_SLEEP        This does not mean that the monster cannot be asleep when you
                meet it, but that you cannot use sleep spells (et al) on it.
                (Compare (4.12).)
NEVER_BLOW      This monster will never attack in melee.
NEVER_ACT       This monster will never move or perform any action at all.
                So this means it is completely harmless.

NO_TARGET       This monster cannot be targetted with target command.
NO_DEATH        This entity can never die.
NO_AUTORET      You won't use auto-retaliation against this entity.

REFLECTING      The monster can deflect bolts and arrows, physical and magical
                projectiles, prolonging the fight.
HURT_LITE       This monster is susceptible to light attacks.
HURT_ROCK       This monster is susceptible to stone-to-mud attacks.

COLD_BLOOD      You cannot spot this monster with infra-vision.
WEIRD_MIND      The monster flickers on ESP.
EMPTY_MIND      The monster does not show up on ESP.

SHAPECHANGER    The monster changes its appearance randomly and quickly.
CHAR_CLEAR      The monster has no visible appearance, not even if you can see
                invisible.

UNMAGIC         Will cancel all temporary magical effects on the player,
                except for mimic form (from polymorph ring) and martyr.
HOLD            Paralyses you from afar.
FORGET          Blanks your mind, makes you forget the dungeon map and details
                of your items (unidentifies items).
TRAPS           Can place traps around you (from afar).
DISBELIEVE      Monster has an anti-magic field, the strength depending on its
                level.

                Like training the 'Anti-magic' skill, having intrinsic anti-
                magic from the DISBELIEVE flag will also shorten the duration
                of certain magical temporary buffs and debuffs on your
                character!
                To see which those are and to see more information about
                anti-magic, see 'Anti-magic' skill in (6.2) and 'Dark Sword' in
                (5.9).

DROP_GOOD       The monster usually drops enchanted items.
DROP_GREAT      The monster usually drops items with ego powers or artifacts.
                Hint: Usually monsters that have this flag are pretty powerful,
                but there are actually some low-to-mid-level monsters that have
                it too, so make sure to kill these when you see them:
                Smeagol (level 3), Wormtongue (level 9), Robin Hood (level 10),
                Boldor (level 15), Azog (level 23), It (level 24, but actually
                impossible to seek out, you'll rather just meet It by chance),
                Sandworm Queen (level 30), The Wight-King of the Barrow-Downs
                (level 35). Azog, the Sandworm Queen and the Wight-King are
                dungeon bosses, so you will only find them on the final floor
                of their respective dungeon.

(5.12) Monster attack mechanism, Armour Class, damage caps
----------------------------------------------------------
Monsters may try to attack you in three different ways:
-Hitting you.
-Shooting you.
-Casting a spell that may wound you.

Monster is trying to hit you:
-----------------------------
If a monster tries to hit you, the following happens:
1) Any shielding magic around you is evaluated and may prevent the attack.
   (Note: Disruption shield is currently evaluated later on.)
   If this doesn't succeed..
2) your character may dodge. If this doesn't succeed..
3) your character may try to parry with a weapon or block with a shield.
   It will mostly choose the action (either parry or block) where it is more
   proficient, although it won't always be able to use the preferable method
   of those two, and sometimes randomly has to rely on the other one.
   If this doesn't succeed..
4) your armour class is evaluated and might catch the attack, in which case
   you don't take any damage, ie the monster misses you. If this doesn't
   succeed..
5) your character takes damage, but your armour class will at least reduce it.

Note that some attacks can bypass some of those defenses.
More info further below.

Monster is trying to shoot you:
-------------------------------
If a monster tries to shoot you, the following happens:
1) Your character may dodge. If this doesn't succeed..
2) any shielding magic around you is evaluated and may prevent the attack.
   (Note: Disruption shield is currently evaluated later on.)
   If this doesn't succeed..
3) if you have REFLECTION you will try to reflect the shot.
   If this doesn't succeed..
4) your character may try to block the shot with a shield.
   If this doesn't succeed..
5) your character takes damage. Armour class has no effect.

Monster is casting a spell that wounds you:
-------------------------------------------
If a monster casts a spell at you, the following happens:
1) Your character may dodge if it's a bolt spell. If this doesn't succeed..
2) any shielding magic around you is evaluated and may prevent the attack.
   (Note: Disruption shield is currently evaluated later on.)
   If this doesn't succeed..
3) if you have REFLECTION and if the spell is a bolt spell, you will try to
   reflect it. If this doesn't succeed..
4) if it's a bolt spell, your character may try to block it with a shield.
   If it isn't then your character may still try to cover behind a shield.
   If this doesn't succeed..
5) your character takes damage. Armour class has no effect.

For details about parrying and blocking see (6.11).


Armour class:
-------------
Armour class helps you twice:
-It makes monsters miss you more often with attacks that don't bypass armour.
 The more AC the better, it's weighed against the level of the attacking
 monster. If the monster is (heavily) stunned it gets penalties here.
-It reduces the damage if a monster manages to hit you with a physical attack.
 This effect caps at 200 AC.

Monsters can score critical hits which can (depending on the attack type)
result in a cutting or stunning effect against the player.
A monster scores a critical hit if it inflicts a damage which is very close to
its theoretical maximum. Weaker monsters (that don't inflict high amounts of
damage) aren't able to score critical hits at all.
The power of the resulting cut/stun depends on the damage too.
So a high armour class helps a lot, to avoid critical monster hits and to
reduce their power.
For more information about monster crits, see (4.11).

Basic monsters (that means before any ego-power such as 'Warrior' or 'Holy'
is applied as in 'Hill troll warrior' or 'Holy 5-headed hydra') have a cap on
melee attacks, which limits their attacks to an _average_ of 700 total damage
points per round (Monsters, depending on their race, can perform up to four
melee attacks each round they can move/act).
Note that the monster may attack for more damage, it's just the averaged value,
the real damage is random and can fluctuate above or below the average.
Wearing armour will further reduce the total average damage you can expect to
take per round from that monster. The cap will be used on the monster's raw
damage output _before_ the player's AC is factored in.
Sanity-draining melee attacks are capped at 55 points of _average_ sanity
damage per _blow_ (not per round).

WARNING: If the monster is an ego-monster (eg the aforementioned 'Warrior'
or 'Holy' ego power) this will modify its damage output _after_ the cap was
applied. That means that some very powerful ego-monsters may deal even more
than cap damage on average per round, although that's very rare.

Note that there are melee attacks that cannot be reduced by armour. It depends
on the way the melee attack is performed. See (5.12a) for details.


(5.12a) Monster attack types and brands
--------------------------------------
Monsters can strike you with branded attacks, for example acidic hits, or hits
that poison you if you get hit. If you resist the according brand you won't be
affected by it alot, and the overall damage will be reduced. If you're immune
you won't be affected at all and only take a physical part of the damage -
if there is a physical part. This depends on the attack type.
Here is a list of attack types and brands:

Attack type      Contact/Cut/Stun/Bypasses AC
---------------------------------------------
HIT                                  + + + -
PUNCH,KICK,BUTT,CRUSH                + - + -
CLAW, BITE                           + + - -
TOUCH,STING,ENGULF,CHARGE,CRAWL      + - - -
SPIT,                                - - - -
GAZE,WAIL,SPORE,EXPLODE,BEG,         - - - +
INSULT,MOAN,DROOL,SHOW,WHISPER       - - - +

Brand           Needed resistance to reduce/avoid its effect
(also called    (These help to avoid the effect but do not mitigate damage
'damage type')  unless explicitely states that they do.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HURT            Only AC - raw damage.
                This damage type can be mitigated by AC.
ACID,ELEC,FIRE,COLD
                According elemental damage.
                The damage can partially be mitigated by having the particular
                (double) resistances or immunities and gets amplified by
                susceptibility.
POISON          poison.
                The damage can partially be mitigated by having the particular
                (double) resistances or immunities and gets amplified by
                susceptibility.
BLIND           blindness.
CONFUSE         confusion (or chaos).
TERRIFY         fear.
PARALYZE        free action.
EXP_xx          hold life.
LOSE_xxx        sustain stats.
EAT_xxx         DEX, stealing skill.
                Device of theft prevention.
                Won't help against EAT_FOOD/EAT_LITE.
UN_BONUS        disenchantment.
                The damage can partially be mitigated by having the resistance.
UN_POWER        no resistance. It drains charges/energy from your items.

                Magic Device skill helps to prevent draining though.
                See (6.10) for more information about the Magic Device skill.

                Mimicking a monster form that has UN_POWER attacks and at the
                same time is a very proficient caster (at least 1_IN_2 spell
                frequency) will help to prevent draining too.

                Also reduces the remaining duration of a polymorph ring form
                the player is currently mimicking (this effect cannot be
                mitigated by magic device skill or unpower-form).
TIME            time.
                The damage can partially be mitigated by having the resistance.
DISEASE         poison.
                This attack can also decrease your constitution.
INSANITY        none. (mimics using WEIRD_MIND/EMPTY_MIND form resist slightly)
HALLU           chaos.
PARASITE        <currently no effect>
DISARM          'Fighting' ability.
                Weapons wielded 2-handely are harder to disarm (stacking).
                Artifacts are also harder to disarm (stacking).
                Heavily cursed items are quite hard to disarm (stacking).
                Note that DISARM effects have a chance to be blocked or parried
                if their attack type can be blocked or parried, which is
                usually the case (they usually have HIT attack type).

                Sometimes disarmed weapons land in your backpack, but sometimes
                you drop them to the ground instead. If there is no empty floor
                (for example because you're fighting on mountain terrain) they
                will instead be scattered across the dungeon level and you will
                have to search it to retrieve them.
FAMINE          none. Makes you hungry.
SEDUCE          none. Makes you take off equipped items.
                Can have random side effects, if your HP are still above 40%
                and if no other players or monsters are standing next to you:
                - drain half of current mana or hit points
                - drain constitution or wisdom
                - get a disease (equals poison effect)
                - lose an item or gold (monster steals it; tools won't help!)
                - gain some experience
                - regain some drained sanity, if any.
SHATTER         purely physical damage. Hits & causes an earthquake - very
                dangerous, see (5.13).
                This damage type can be mitigated by AC.
LITE            Light or blindness resistance.
                The damage can partially be mitigated by having light
                resistance and gets amplified by susceptibility.

Getting hit by higher undead creatures may also infect you with the
Black Breath! (See (1.3a) for more information about Black Breath.)


Further, monsters may have one or more spells they can cast. Breathing elements
and shooting or throwing boulders belong to those too (but aren't affected by
anti-magic fields since they aren't 'real spells' but rather physical actions).

Among the monster spells, such as casting bolt or ball spells, teleporting,
healing, trying to blind/scare/confuse/paralyze/slow the player, summoning
other monsters for help, or speeding itself up with a haste-self spell, there
are some particularly special spells that will be explained here in more
detail:

SHRIEK          Not a real spell but a physical action, some monsters can emit
                an aggravating noise that will wake up all nearby monsters and
                even haste those within line-of-sight of the shrieker.
                This can be extremely dangerous and you'll see a light red
                message in the combat message log when a monster shrieks.
                If you have the sound pack installed, you'll also clearly hear
                it, which can help further to react quickly: On shallow levels
                shrieking might not be that bad, but on deep levels it might
                well be reason enough to teleport out instantly.
TRAPS           Again not a spell but nasty nevertheless. The monster casts a
                3x3 'circle' of traps around you, watch where you step.
UNMAGIC         This can be extremely nasty for istari. Unmagic cancels nearly
                all kind of magic effects your character is currently under,
                such as speed from a speed potion and even Disruption Shield.
                This won't affect classes much such as warriors and archers but
                is life-threatening if it neutralizes the Disruption Shield
                of an Istar. (Note: Holy Martyr cannot be cancelled.)
MIND_BLAST      A psionic attack spell that hurts your sanity and can cause
                confusion and hallucinations.
BRAIN_SMASH     A powerful psionic attack spell that hurts your sanity and can
                cause blindness, confusion, paralyzation and slowness.
FORGET          This mind blanking spell will create darkness around you and
                make you forget about some or all of the items you are carrying
                effectively un-identifying them (except for flavoured items).
HOLD            Although not so special and already mentioned in the text above
                this spell is listed because it's a ranged paralyzation spell.
                Ghouls can do this for example, so make sure that you get
                Free Action as early as possible, definitely before venturing
                into Mordor though.



(5.13) Earthquakes
------------------
Earthquakes will cause ceilings to collapse and the ground to shift and crack,
burying items, players and monsters and inflicting a lot of damage.
All fields in a certain radius around the epicentre have a certain chance to
be filled with rocks, to be cleared from previous obstacles (walls) and turn
into empty floor fields, or to remain untouched and unchanged.

Players don't take damage from their 'own' earthquakes, caused by their
equipment or items (for example weapons of earthquakes or scrolls of
*destruction*).

Earthquakes can deal up to 300 damage if you cannot evade the falling rocks
and shifting ground: Depending on the number of unchanged (by the earthquake)
empty fields that are adjacent to your character, there is a chance to 'evade'
and take much less damage or even none at all. Earthquakes can also stun you.

Items will usually be destroyed/lost. Stairs and void jump gates are immune.

Monsters killed by earthquakes do not yield experience, loot or other credit,
same as goes for monsters erased by *destruction* or genocide.



(5.14) Curses
-------------
Several items you find will be {cursed}!
Cursed items usually have bad effects that outweigh or dominate their useful
abilities, and you cannot take them off once you equipped them, as long as
the curse isn't broken. Cursed artifacts and ego items are pseudo-id'ed as
{terrible}. Shops won't buy cursed items, they might buy the item after the
curse is broken, however.
If you equip an unidentified item and it carries a curse your character will
notice 'Oops, it feels deadly cold!'.

Note: Instead of dropping an item which curse you have successfully broken,
      you may of course also just outright destroy it with 'k' key instead.
      You cannot destroy artifacts though (for example Rings of Power dropped
      by Nazgul).

There are different types of curses:
CURSED          can be broken by a regular 'remove curse'.
                Item cannot be taken off or destroyed (via 'k' key) until the
                curse is broken.
HEAVY_CURSE     requires a strong '*remove curse*' to be broken.
                Item cannot be removed until the curse is broken.
                On weapons, there is a high chance of resisting disarming.
                See the hint regarding the use of enchant scrolls to break a
                heavy curse instead of using a *rc* scroll, written at the
                bottom of this paragraph!
PERMA_CURSE     This curse can never be broken.
                Item can never be taken off or otherwise removed again!
                Mimics polymorphing into a form that cannot wear the specific
                item won't succeed getting rid of it either, instead they will
                still have the item equipped!
                There is absolutely no way to get rid of this item. If you
                find a way then you found a bug =).
CURSE_NO_DROP   these items cannot be dropped from inventory as long as the
                curse isn't broken. CURSE_NO_DROP occurs together with
                CURSED or HEAVY_CURSE.
AUTO_CURSE      occurs together with CURSED or HEAVY_CURSE.
                If the curse is broken, AUTO_CURSE items will automatically
                recurse themselves as soon as the item is equipped, taken off,
                or picked up. To get rid of an AUTO_CURSEd item that you don't
                need anymore (d)rop it to the ground after the curse has been
                broken. If you had the item equipped, don't take it off but
                (d)rop it to the ground right from your equipment! Otherwise
                it will recurse itself.
                To drop directly from your equipment, press '/' key at the
                "drop what?" prompt, which will switch to equipment (and back
                to inventory if pressed again).
TY_CURSE        Randomly drains stats sometimes, even if the item is uncursed.
                (TY_CURSE will stay, even if the 'normal' curse is broken!)
                Lowers the items value by 15000 Au.
                This curse will be on hold while you're in a town, and will
                also occur rather rarely while you're on the world surface,
                ie not within a dungeon or tower.
                Note that your saving throw has a chance to suppress it.
                Having 'Holy Support' skill at 40.000 or better will completely
                negate TY_CURSE effects.
                ("It carries an ancient foul curse.")
DG_CURSE        Rarely summons a random monster on you, even if uncursed.
                (DG_CURSE will stay, even if the 'normal' curse is broken!)
                Greatly lowers the items value by 25000 Au.
                This curse will be on hold while you're in a town.
                Note that an anti-magic field has a chance to suppress it.
                Having 'Holy Support' skill at 40.000 or better will completely
                negate TY_CURSE effects.
                ("It carries an ancient morgothian curse.")

If 'CURSED' or 'HEAVY_CURSE' occurs on a weapon or armour piece, the curses
can alternatively be broken by enchanting the item's stats above +0 manually.
(The enchant service of shops won't help!)
Each enchantment of any of their stats (to-hit, to-dam, to-ac) above +0 has
a certain chance to break the curse. This can often be cheaper than buying a
*Remove Curse* scroll for HEAVY_CURSE items.
This is an especially commonly used trick for getting rid of Morgul weapons.
Just pick the stat that is already higher. Example:
A Dagger of Morgul (-33,-15) -> You'd enchant its damage to +0 or higher,
since it requires you to buy less scrolls (15+) than going for to-hit (33+).
If the item you want to enchant is among your equipment instead of your
inventory, press '/' key at the "enchant what?" prompt, which will switch to
equipment (and back to inventory if pressed again).

Vampires have a special take on curses:
If an item is heavily cursed and it is NOT the "of nothingness" type (weapons)
then if a vampire (true one, not mimicked) equips it its negative boni will
flip to positive numbers. Also vampires tend to greatly resist certain bad
effects that heavily cursed items may exert, making for example Morgul weapons
and some heavily cursed artifacts quite useful. Note that the curse must be
heavy, not normal, for this bonus-flipping to work. Look up the Vampire race
description in (6.4) for more information.



(5.15) Vampirism
----------------
Weapons and other items that you can equip may be 'vampiric' (see (5.8)),
meaning that they drain life from your target.
Mimics who use a vampire form and players of 'Vampire' race will also get a
vampiric 'brand' on their melee attacks (see (6.7)).
Vampirism does not work with magic, only with physical attacks.

Vampiric life draining heals you with a part of the damage you afflicted on
your target, almost each hit! The more damage you deal and the more attacks per
round you have, the more life you will leech back. There's a maximum amount of
HP which you can leech from a victim per round, but this cap isn't really
reached until your character deals quite a lot of damage, remember:
Leeching is based on a fraction of your damage dealt.

Vampirism does not work on all types of monsters. From some it is not possible
to drain life force. Those immune to vampirism are:
- undead monsters
- nonliving monsters
- in general, all elementals ('E'), golems ('g') and vortices ('v').
Although demons and angels don't really 'live', vampirism is able to drain
the powers that allow them to exist, and so vampirism works against those too.

The best case is to have vampiric flag on a weapon, that will drain at maximum
efficiency. However, it will only drain if you hit the monster with that
particular weapon.
If you use other vampiric equipment, like gloves, they will be a bit less
efficient than an actual vampiric weapon, meaning that you will leech less
frequently (the amount of leeched life per hit is not penalized though) but in
turn it will work with any weapon you use (ranged too).
For ranged weapons it doesn't matter whether the bow or the ammunition is
vampiric. It won't increase your over all life leeching if both are vampiric
either.

Note that vampirism gained from mimicked forms only works on melee combat.
Vampires (real ones as well as mimicked ones) usually only are half efficient
at vampiric leeching, compared to vampiric weapons, due to half of vampires'
attacks being normal hits and the other half being biting (which does the
actual leeching).

In general, vampiric flags don't stack from multiple sources! Just the source
that fits the situation best (usually weapon/ammo) overrides the weaker ones
(usually non-weapons). Here is a table of priority - as was just explained,
only the most powerful source is applied, the rest is ignored:

Vampirism source priority table (from best at the top to worst at the bottom)
The best source overrides all weaker ones, which simply get ignored:
| Melee                               | Ranged                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Weapon                     100%     | Shooter                     50%     |
| Vampire bat/mist form      100%     | Ammunition                  50%     |
| Vampire character race      50% (*) |                                     |
| Other vampiric forms        50%     |                                     |
| Non-weapons (gloves)   50%/100% (**)| Non-weapons (gloves)        33%     |
| Fruit bat (native only)     50%     |                                     |
| Fruit bat (potion only)     33%     |                                     |

(Mimicked fruit bats don't get vampirism.)

(*) Training Necromancy and Traumaturgy schools can increase this further,
    see the skills' descriptions for details.

(**) 100% if on gloves and fighting without weapon and shield (Martial Arts),
    50% otherwise.



(5.16) Invisibility
-------------------
Invisibility on monsters is binary, either they are invisible to a player (if
he doesn't have 'see invisible' ability) or they aren't (if he does have it).
Note that ESP overrides invisibility, so if an invisible monster isn't
empty-minded (or has special ESP-cloaking such as 'telepath' ego monsters) you
can spot it with the matching ESP even if you don't have 'see invisible'
ability. Some type of magic may detect invisible monster too, while some other
creature-detection type of magic actually fails against invisible monsters.
Players who don't have 'see invisible' but have infra-vision (and aren't
blinded) can also see invisible monsters if they aren't cold-blooded.

For players being invisible it depends:
-Invisibility from spells has a certain power shown in the spell's info.
-Invisibility from items uses 4/5 of the player's level for power
 (player level is capped at 50).
-Invisiblity from monster form (mimicry users) is similar to invisibility from
 items, except that its power is the average of monsterlevel/2 and playerlevel,
 with monsterlevel capping at 100 and playerlevel capping at 50.
Invisibility powers from different sources do not stack, the best one overrides
the weaker ones.
Some items that grant invisibility also have +mods on them (for example '+3'),
these don't affect the invisibility itself, but are usually just an extra
+stealth bonus or some completely different kind of bonus that item also
happens to grant (use *Identify* to find out).

The actual effect invisibility has on gameplay will also be affected by player
and monster level, the ability to see invisible, and shadow cloaks, as follows
here:

A player who is invisible is harder to spot for monsters in the way that they
only have a certain chance to see the player on each turn, making them move
erratically instead of directly targetting the player. This also helps against
casters, archers or breathers who won't be able to target you as well (often)
as they usually could. Your invisibility power is continously compared to the
monster's level, causing an internal 'dice roll' that determines whether or not
the monster will see you on each turn.

Being invisible costs your body a lot of effort, resulting in getting hungry
quickly.

Invisibility won't work at all on monsters that are..
        -invisible too.
        -game bosses (Sauron, Morgoth, Zu-Aon).
        -Dragonriders, they have ESP.
        -nonliving monsters with empty mind (not using optical senses).
        -able to see through the rogue-specific 'cloaking' ability,
         see the cloaking command description in (0.2) for a list.

All other monsters are randomly affected by the player's invisibility,
meaning that they will only sometimes be able to spot him (they will see the
player kind of 'flickering').
The closer a monster is, the better its chances to spot the player.
Some monsters have better chances to spot the player, depending on
        -distance to the player,
        -level of the player (higher level = harder to spot),
        -monster class (Dragons, demons, undead, animals, never sleeping
                        monsters and smart monsters are better at it;
                        orcs, trolls, stupid monsters are worse),
        -the vision power of the monster,
        -the level of the monster,
        -player carrying a light source (not affected by vampires' "intrinsic
         light"), doubles the chance of spotting him,
        -player wearing an aggravating item, further triples the chance.

Invisibility also affects other players:
If another player is invisible and of higher level than you..
        -you can see him if you can see invisible and he's not wearing a
         shadow cloak;
        -otherwise he'll be completely invisible to you.
If another player is invisible and not of higher level than you..
        -you can see him easily if you can see invisible and he's not wearing
         a shadow cloak;
        -you see him 'flicker' if you lack seeing invisible or if he's wearing
         a shadow cloak (or both). He will fade in and out of your sight.
         If you want to look at his equipment with the  '  key, then you'll
         need some timing, might take several tries.
Invisibility (on players) overrides ESP. So it does help in a (blood bond)
duel even if the opponent has ESP.

The effect of invisibility is greatly reduced in PvP (you cannot become
completely invisible even if your level is higher than the other player) but
still gives a slight edge.


Cloaking:
---------
The ability to cloak themselves is exclusive to rogues and automatically
acquired at level 15. This will effectively render them invisible, but it is in
fact NOT the "Invisibility" that has been described above.
Cloaking overrides any detection mechanism, a cloaked player can only be seen
by party members, certain special monsters, or while the cloaking is weakened
because the cloaked player performed certain (noisy) actions.
See (0.2) for more information about cloaking.



(5.17) How abilities, resistances and boni stack
------------------------------------------------
(Also see (5.6) for basic information about damaage types and resistances.)

The same resistance from two or more items in your equipment don't add to each
other. For example you only need one item that provides fire resistance. If
you equip two such items you won't get better resistance than with just one
item. You cannot get "double resistance" from two items' permanent resistances.
This rule applies to all resistances and abilities that don't use a bonus
number to indicate their effectiveness, like faster mana replenishing or hit
point regeneration, telepathic powers, slow digestion, etc.

However, there is a way to further increase your resistances temporarily:
(NOTE: THIS ONLY APPLIES FOR BASE (fire/cold/acid/elec) AND POISON RESISTANCE!)

Use an item that provides some temporary resistance. Temporary resistance and
permanent (such from your equipment) resistance stack and their effects are
multiplied! For example if you wear a shield of resist fire and you quaff a
potion of resist heat you'll have double fire resistance as long as the potion
lasts, resulting in fire damage being cut down to 1/9 instead of 1/3! This is
nearly as good as having fire immunity. (1/3 perm res * 1/3 temp res =
1/9 total res).
Not only potions can boost your resistances temporarily, some items can also
be activated for temporary resistance, for example cloaks of lordly resistance
or elemental protection rings or certain artifacts.

Stat increases or ability increases that are not 'flags' (flag means you either
have it or you don't) but that use bonus numbers will add to each other.
For example an orcish shield (+2) that increases your strength by +2 and a
kolla (+1) which also increases your strength (just by +1) will add up and
your character's strength will be increased by +3 in total!
Same goes for IV (Infra-Vision), luck, extra attacks, speed, etc.

There are some abilities which are not flags although they might look like it.
In fact, they add up / stack. Those are:
-Extra shots (concerning ranged weapons)
-Extra might (concerning ranged weapons)
-Drain mana ('Drains your magic'. Note that 'mana regeneration' (also called
 mana-charging) does NOT stack. So it can cancel out the effect of only ONE
 item that drains mana, not of any more). See (4.11a) for more information.
-Drain hit points ('Drains your health'. note that 'regeneration' does NOT
 stack, so it can cancel out the effect of only ONE item that drains hit
 points, not of any more. However, the 'Health' skill is able to further
 increase your regeneration rate). See (4.11a) for more information.
-Drain experience ('Drains your life force'). See (4.11a) for more information.
-Extra light radius



(5.18) Monster auras
--------------------
Some monsters have auras of flashing lightning, freezing cold or furious
flames surrounding them! If a player engages such foes in close combat, each
time he lands a blow the aura will retaliate, dealing lightning / cold / fire
damage depending on the aura type. Some monsters even have multiple auras.
The damage of such auras may be significant. Especially important is the fact,
that the faster a player hits a monster, the more he will suffer from its
auras.

The damage an aura deals is decided by a dice roll:
[1 + (monsterlevel/26)] d [1 + (monsterlevel / 17)]

Example:
A warrior of level 30 is fighting a storm giant. The storm giant has an aura
of lightning surrounding him. The warrior is able to deal 6 blows per round
with his current weapon. The warrior has a source of permanent lightning
resistance (elvenkind armour), he lacks potions of resistance or lightning
immunity though. This means:

Storm giant has monster level 35 (assumed the warrior encounters him on
dungeon level 35), so his lightning aura will inflict 2d3 damage each hit.
The warrior has lightning resistance, so the damage will be cut down to 1/3,
which is 1 or 2.
Since the warrior has 6 bpr, he will suffer between 6 and 12 (6*1 and 6*2)
damage per turn while hitting the storm giant.



(5.19) Experience-draining items
--------------------------------
Some items, such as randart rings of power (dropped by Nazgul) drain your
experience points permanently. Here are some details about that process:
-Experience drain from multiple items stacks, although it doesnt add in a
 linear way. So, wearing two rings of power won't drain twice as fast as one,
 but about 1,5x as fast.
-Experience drain is not temporary, so it cannot be restored by potions of
 restore life levels. To make up for it, you'll have to kill monsters..faster.
-Experience drain won't go further than the experience you need at least to
 maintain your current character level. If you reach that experience border,
 experience drain will stop, even if you still have the items equipped.
 So you will not lose levels from experience drain.
 HOWEVER: If a monster or other effect drains your experience below your
 current level, the experience drain from items will kick in again!
-Experience drain will happen much slower if you're on the world surface,
 ie not inside a dungeon or tower.
-Experience drain will completely hold while you're in a town, so you can just
 take any time you want for shopping or sitting out blacklists, without losing
 any experience at all.



(5.20) Digging
--------------
Your chance to successfully tunnel through an obstacle depends on the obstacle
and your 'digging power'.

If you're not interested in the exact formula, skip down to (5.20b) which has a
table with example values for certain scenarios.


(5.20a) Digging - Exact calculation
-----------------------------------
Your digging power is calculated as follows:
An equipped item that provides (+X) to digging will add 20*X.
If you have a digging tool equipped, its weight is added (eg 25.0 lb -> +25).
If the digging tool is enchanted to hit or to damage, those values are added.
The power value so far is now multiplied by a value between 1 and 2, depending
on your 'Digging' skill (see (6.2)). If the skill is 0, the multiplier is 1, if
it's 50, the multiplier is 2. Otherwise the value is linearly inbetween.
After that, a bonus is added depending on your strength:
Ranging from +0 at 3 over +10 at 18/10, +50 at 18/110 up to +100 at 18/***.

If you don't have a digging tool equipped, your total digging power is halved.

If your resulting final digging power is zero, then it is set to 1, so you
always have at least a tiny chance of digging through the weaker materials
that have a +0 difficulty (see table below).

To successfully dig through certain features, your digging power must be
greater than the result of a random number roll "random(0..x-1) + y":
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rubble      200 +  0
Ivy         200 +  0
Bushes      300 +  0
Dead trees  300 +  0
Trees       400 +  0
Sandwalls   250 +  5
Magma       400 + 10
Quartz      800 + 20
Granite    1600 + 40
The +y is a fixed value that gets added to the random roll of (0..x-1), the
sum of this is what you have to overcome with your digging power value.
For example you cannot successfully tunnel through quartz if you don't
have at least 21 digging power, since you have to overcome the +20.

Example: If you have 21 digging power and try to dig into quartz you'll have to
be very lucky and hope for the random(0..799) roll for quartz to actually be a
0 so that the result will be 0+20 which is 20 and therefore smaller than your
digging power of 21. So on each turn of tunnelling your chance to succeed would
be 1 in 800 in that case.


(5.20b) Digging - Common example values
---------------------------------------
Some example values, assuming 0.000 'Digging' skill
and unenchanted (ie (+0,+0)) digging tools with (+1) to digging:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Without a digging tool..
-You always have a chance to remove rubble and organic material, even without
 a digging tool. Might take quite a while if your strength is low though.
-You cannot tunnel through granite wall without a digging tool if your STRength
 is below 18/180.
-You cannot tunnel through quartz without a digging tool if your STRength is
 below 18/100.
-You cannot tunnel through magma without a digging tool if your STRength is
 below 18/60.
-You cannot tunnel through sand walls without a digging tool if your STRength
 is below 18/20.

With a digging tool..
-You can tunnel through all materials other than granite walls with just a
 basic shovel even if your STRength is only 3.
 (For quartz, you have a 3% chance to succeed at 18/50 STR with the shovel
  and at 18/10 STR with a pick. If you use an enchanted shovel (+9,+9) (+1)
  however, you already have a 3% chance to succeed at only 5 STR.)
-You cannot tunnel through granite with a basic shovel if your STRength is
 below 18/30.
-You cannot tunnel through granite with a basic pick if your STRength is
 below 12.

You can tunnel through all tunneable materials, no matter your strength, with..
-a (+1) shovel that has +hit and +dam enchanted to a total of at least +15.
-a (+1) pick that has +hit and +dam enchanted to a total of at least +6.
-any (+2) digging tool or better (except if it has negative +hit/+dam values).


(5.20c) Digging - Further information
-------------------------------------
For digging through granite wall without having to wait for ages to succeed,
you will definitely want a better digging tool than basic shovels or picks.
For example ones 'of Digging', a magical ego power for digging tools.
Or higher level diggers such as gnomish, orcish or dwarven diggers or mattocks,
which have a higher base digging bonus that just (+1).

Tunnelling into walls that are actually secret doors will be treated as if
you were 'searching' instead of tunnelling. You cannot find secret doors in
permanent (aka non-tunneable) walls this way though, such as mountains.
Tunnelling into known doors will just try to open them instead.
If a door is stuck, you will want to 'B'ash it instead of tunnelling, since
you cannot just open stuck doors the normal way.

Tunnelling might reveal special floor features, items or gold (walls that are
displayed as a '*' symbol will reveal cash worth of gems or precious metal, but
those walls might not always show it until you use 'Treasure Detection' or
'Treasure Location' magic), see 'Digging' skill in (6.2) for details.
Also see (3.4a) for more information on digging tool mods.

If you haven't got a digging tool equipped, or if it's just a basic shovel (+1)
then wielding a sword or especially an axe can work as pseudo-digger when you
want to hack down organic material such as trees, bushes, ivy or spider webs.
Certain polearms that have a slashing effect (scythes and sickles) can help
just as well as swords or axes against spider webs or ivy.
(Dual-wielding does not help, so two weapons can't dig better than just one.
Wielding a 1.5-handed weapon in only 1 hand will decrease your digging chance
though, so take off your shield for best results.)



(5.21) Recharging
-----------------
Wands, staves and rods are generally called 'magical devices' in the stricter
sense, this paragraph is about those and those are the only items that can be
manually recharged by the player at will.
There are in the broader sense of the word 'magic device' other items too that
can be activated to unleash a specific kind of magic, such as certain jewelry,
artifacts and special ego-powered items. These cannot be recharged at will
however, the user will just have to wait till they are ready again.

While wands and staves use a charges counter to measure if they are depleted or
not, rods have an internal charge that is completely depleted on using it and
will slowly build up again on its own - depending on the user's magic device
skill the depletion may be less severe, the rod will therefore take less time
to recharge if it had been zapped by a proficient magic device user.

While electricity or disenchantment based attacks may deplete magic devices,
they can usually also be manually recharged when necessary!
So wands and staves will need to be actively recharged by the player when
depleted, while rods (and other, not manually rechargeable items) will
automatically recharge themselves over time, displaying 'charging' label or
just '#' if the item name is very long and there's not enough space.

Recharging can be done via shop service, a scroll, another magic device or a
magic spell.
For wands and staves recharging will replenish their charges, while for rods
recharging will reduce their 'charging' delay, aka refill their energy.

When an item is recharged the result depends on the method of recharging and
the item's base type level. For wands and staves it also depends on the current
amount of charges in the device: To minimize the risk of a failure you should
only recharge wands and staves that are already fully depleted ie have zero
charges left.
In general, higher recharge power and lower base item level result in...
 -lower chance for the recharge process to fail,
 -chance for gaining a higher amount of charges replenished.

If unlucky, recharging may result in a failure. Even when recharging at highest
magic spell level there is still a very slim chance for a failure to occur.
While a failed recharge may drain rods even further, wands and staves may
either just get their charges depletes or they may even blow up completely,
depending on your (bad) luck.
So only recharge those when they are already fully depleted to minimize that
risk.

Means of recharging:
-Scrolls            (60 power)
-Thingol artifact   (60..100 power, depending on magic device skill)
-Shop service       (80 power)
-Magic spell        (10..140 power)
-Rune spell         (10..100 power)

The power determines both, the chance of succeeding in recharging the item and
the degree of recharging done to the item.
Some lesser means of recharging might not be powerful enough to recharge rods.

Staves and wands 'of plenty' will receive about twice as many charges from
recharging (with the risk of breaking remaining unchanged) so look out for
those!

If you try to recharge a whole stack of devices in one go, the risk for it to
fail is actually the same as if you recharged just a single item.
You will get the amount of charges replenished to every single magic device in
the stack, at a slight rate of diminishing returns.
In other words: Recharging stacks is okay, it can save you a lot of scrolls of
recharging, just don't go too crazy with the stacks size.



(5.22) Wraithform
-----------------
Wraithform, or "pass wall" form is a character state obtained from the spell
"Wraithform" (Udun school) or from certain items (either spectral weapons or
items that give permanent wraithform: "It renders you incorporeal").
It allows a character to pass through solid walls easily, but at the same time
prevents them from attacking anything else in close combat, except if the
target is also able to pass walls (ie possesses wraithform too, or is actually
a ghost or other monster that can pass through walls).
Also, spells cast while in wraithform will only deal half as much damage as
usual.

Items that provide wraithform are:
-Spectral weapons ('A' to activate them for temporary wraithform).
-Ethereal Dragon Scale Mail and Death Dragon Scale Mail (just wear it and you
 obtain wraithform until you take it off again).

There is a confirmation message when using the Wraithform spell:
"You turn into a wraith!" when you attain wraithform.
"You lose your wraith powers." when your wraithform runs out.

Wraithform is very powerful since it allows you to move around the dungeon
without having to follow its room/passages structure, making it easy to pick
encounters or loot items you detected on the ground via detection magic,
and to escape dangerous situations easily (just retreat into walls).



(5.23) Item sharing rules and exceptions
----------------------------------------
The following item sharing rules apply to a standard server configuration.
It is possible that a server runs certain alterations of some aspects.


Trading items between characters of different mode
--------------------------------------------------
Usually items cannot be exchanged between characters of different modes, eg
everlasting mode, pvp mode and other modes.
Normal mode and unworldly mode characters can exchange items though, they are
basically unified as 'non-everlasting' mode aka 'scoreboard mode'.
They too cannot exchange items with pvp mode characters though.
Game pieces are an exception and can always be used by anyone.

(If the server is running a non-standard configuration, it might be possible
for everlasting or pvp characters to actually pick up items from other modes
but not vice versa.)


Trading zero-level items
------------------------
Level 0 items, which are either starter items, special boss drops or event
reward items can only be used by the first owner and are unusable by anyone
else. Certain event parchments can actually be traded despite being level 0.


Exceptions for emergency cases
------------------------------
Certain items can be exchanged freely between incompatible modes to make rescue
missions easier:
Torches, food, scrolls of satisfy hunger, oil flasks, Word of Recall scrolls.
These items will get a 100% discount when they are exchanged between modes.

An exception for level 0 items are the following starter items:
Torches, food, scrolls of satisfy hunger.
They too will get a 100% discount and their level will actually change to 1.


Special restrictions
--------------------
Items usually cannot be sent via telekinesis if the target player does not
meet the item's level requirements.
True artifacts usually cannot be picked up by a player who does not meet the
item's level requirements.
Some items can only be used by 'winners' (characters who have beaten Morgoth).
These items cannot be sent via telekinesis to a non-winner either.


Dungeon-specific exceptions
---------------------------
In the ironman deep dive challenge (IDDC) and in the Nether Realm dungeon,
items can actually be traded between any character mode.
Within the IDDC, item levels don't even have any effect!
For the Nether Realm, the items must have been found within the Nether Realm.
As soon as a character leaves the worldmap sector of the Nether Realm, the
items lose their ability to be traded between incompatible character modes.



(6) Character details
=====================
(6.1) Attributes
----------------
Characters have six 'attributes', also called 'stats', which are strength,
intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma.
These depend on your race and class and the stat assignments you did during
character creation process.

Stats are displayed as values from 3 (minimum) to 18.
(Note: This can be changed in TomeNET options, press key =1 and toggle
'linear_stats' option. It is recommended to keep the traditional way though,
which represents the D&D system of throwing three 6-sided dice to determine a
stat).

Certain effects can drain stats, for example unresisted fire or cold damage can
drain your strength, unresisted lightning damage your dexterity, unresisted
acid damage your charisma. Also many monsters have stat-draining attacks.
Traps can also drain your stats, some temporarily and some permanently.
If a stat is drained and can be restored it will be displayed in yellow.
In that case buy a potion for restoring that particular stat from town store 5
provided it is not out of stock in which case you'll have to wait a bit or go
to another town. Maybe the stat drain isn't even that important to you and you
save your money for the time being.
Some traps can permanently drain a stat, in which case it gets lowered but
remains green instead of turning yellow. In this case a stat restoring potion
has no effect, instead you'll need a "stat potion" that increases a stat
permanently (up to a certain limit depending on class/race).

It is possible to gain even higher stats, those will be displayed as 18/xxx
where xxx is roughly the value above 18 multiplied by 10 (to allow fractions).
Examples:
18/10 is like 19 (ie 18+1).
18/120 is like 30 (ie 18+12).
18/47 is like 22. The fraction 0.7 is not factoring into actual gameplay.

If you quaffed the maximum of "stat potions" (potions raising your stats), the
maxed out attribute will be displayed in light umber.
An attribute is maxed out at 18/100 +/- racial/class modifiers.
Examples:
Human Adventurer has 18/100 + 0 + 0 = 18/100 cap for all stats, see (6.4) for
race boni and (6.5) for class boni.
Draconian Istar has an intelligence cap of 18/100 + 2 (Draconian) + 3
(Istar) = 18/150.

Stats can be raised over the character's cap by equipment. The total possible
maximum of an attribute is always 18/220 (40), which is displayed as '18/***'
or '**' if using linear_stats.

Strength (STR)
    -How heavy may your weapon, bow or shield be? You can't fight with a
     weapon that is too heavy for you.
    -How heavy may your armour be? You will lose mana, boni or combat abilties
     if it's too heavy for you.
    -How much damage do you inflict on enemies in melee combat? (to-mdam bonus)
    -Are you able to deliver several blows per round with your weapon?
     (For details, also see (6.5).)
    -How much can you carry in your backpack without getting slowed down?
    -How easily you can bash doors open.
    -How far you can throw items.
    -Allows you to try hard to swim and not drown in deep water.
    -How easily you can dig.
Intelligence (INT)
    -Has influence on your mana pool size. (class-dependant)
    -How well can you cast spells that use INT to determine failure rate?
    -Has influence on your ability to activate magic devices.
    -Has influence on your trap-disarming ability.
    -Do you notice if someone tries to steal from you?
    Also see (6.10) for more information about the 'Magic Device' skill.
Wisdom (WIS)
    -How well can you cast priest prayers or other spells that use WIS to
     determine failure rate?
    -Has influence on your mana pool size. (class-dependant)
    -How well can you resist malicious influences like poison, paralyzation,
     or confusion? (Means, your Saving Throw is depending on your WIS. See
     (6.3) for details about Saving Throw.)
    -Wisdom directly increases your sanity. Be careful! If you're very low on
     sanity taking off a +wisdom item can mean your death, in case your sanity
     drops to 0 by taking off the item.
Dexterity (DEX)
    -Has positive influence on your armour class and on your chance to hit
     enemies, also quite important for ranged weapons to-hit chance.
    -How well can you steal (from shops)? (A high DEX won't help much if your
     'Stealing' skill is zero by the way ;)
    -Are you able to deliver several blows per round with your weapon?
     (For details, also see (6.5).)
    -How likely are items or money stolen from you?
    -Can you prevent getting stunned from bashing a door clumsily?
    -Allows you to try hard to swim and not drown in deep water.
    -Has influence on your trap-disarming ability.
Constitution (CON)
    -How many HP (hit points) do you have? Very essential.
     Note that CON effect caps depending on your character level. Roughly:
     At level 20 you can't utilize more than 18/60 CON. That means even if
     you raise your constitution above that value, your Hit Points won't
     increase as long as your character is level 20.
     At level 30, CON cap is 18/130, at level 40 it's 18/190, and at level
     45 and higher the full CON bonus is utilized for determining Hit Points.
    -Also reduces the duration of poisonous and stunning effects on you.
    -Increases your stamina regeneration rate.
    -Reduces drowning (also for aquatic forms outside of water) effects.
Charisma (CHR)
    -Do you get good prices in shops? :)
     Note that shop prices also depend on racial preferences of the
     shopkeepers vs their customers. It is said, that Half-Trolls have an
     especially hard time.
     While prices of items and houses are affected by charisma, fees for shop
     services are not.
    -Allows you to resist getting seduced.



(6.2) Skills, opposed skills
----------------------------
If you rise in character levels by gaining experience, you also get skill
points to distribute on various abilities. To invoke the skill system overview
press 'G' (capital G!).
If you make a mistake while distributing skill points, look up the /undoskills
command in (0.2b). "/undoskills" can only be used once per level.


Skills of dark grey colour cannot be used by your character at all.
Skills that are light grey are just dummy skills that serve for organizing
other skills in paragraphs.
Skills coloured orange can be used by your character, but are currently still
at zero.
Skills that your character can train and that have already been increased above
zero will change from orange to white.
Skills that have reached their maximum possible value and therefore cannot be
increased any further are displayed in light blue.

You can collapse/expand blocks of subskills by pressing RETURN key while having
selected the parent skill of that block. Useful for example for collapsing
whole blocks of skills that you cannot or don't want to use anyway.


Here is a list of the available skills and brief explanations to each one:
Note that not every skill is available to every profession (class).

+Combat                         Lets you wear heavier armour without mana
                                points penalty.

                                Lets you wear heavier armour without losing
                                dodge chance (gained from the 'Dodging' skill),
                                or other roguish abilities like
                                boni from dual-wielding, Critical-strike,
                                area-searching and cloaking.

                                Lets you wear heavier armour without getting
                                a penalty to to-hit or sneakiness from being
                                movement-encumbered.

                                Note that Combat skill does NOT affect the
                                continuous ranged-to-hit reduction based on
                                armour weight.
                                (See (5.5) for details about encumberment.)

                                Note that Martial Arts penalties from heavy
                                armour cannot be reduced by training Combat.

                                Ability to pseudo-ID items: You can sense
                                if items are terrible, worthless, cursed,
                                average, good, excellent or special.
                                At the beginning you will only feel 'cursed'
                                or 'good'.
                                Raise combat skill to at least 11 to get
                                more distinctive feelings about melee weapons
                                and armour.
                                A powerful combattant (combat 31) senses the
                                usefulness of ranged weapons and ammunition
                                more distinctively, even if (s)he's not
                                knowledgeable in archery otherwise.
                                A very powerful one (combat 41) can also
                                roughly estimate usefulness of magical items.
                                The further you train Combat, the faster you
                                will pseudo-id items.

                                Increases Fear/Stun/Confuse duration of the
                                target (if attacking causes those).
                                Reduces duration of Fear/Stun/Confuse effects
                                that are applied to you.

                                Increases 'Fighting' and 'Bows/Throws'
                                abilities somewhat, thereby increasing your
                                chance to hit with melee, ranged weapons and
                                when throwing an item and reducing your chance
                                to get disarmed.

                                If your Combat skill isn't zero, then you can
                                press 'm' to check your base chance of
                                parrying (weapon) and blocking (shield), see
                                (6.11) for more details about parry/block.

    +Weaponmastery              Slightly increases melee to-dam and to-hit for
                                armed combat: Hit gets increased by 1/3 of your
                                skill, damage by 1/10.
                                Improves your 'Fighting' ability somewhat,
                                thereby further increasing your chance to hit
                                with melee weapons and reducing your chance to
                                get disarmed.

                                Slightly increases your chance to score
                                critical hits in armed combat (Note: The skill
                                'Critical-strike' has much more effect.)

                                Weaponmastery will also increase your parry
                                chance a good deal (see (6.11) for details):
                                Up to +10% for 1-handers, +15% for 1.5-handers,
                                +20% for 2-handers.

        +Sword-mastery          Greatly improves to-hit/to-dam with swords.
                                At 25 and 50 you will get +1 blow per round
                                while having a sword equipped.

            .Critical-strike    Increases your chance to score hits of
                                extremely high damage. This skill improves
                                the chance to score critical hits and adds
                                to critical-hit bonus from your equipment.

                                NOTES ABOUT CRITICAL-STRIKE SKILL:
                                Critical-strike skill only helps light swords,
                                not heavier than 10.0 lb., while critical-hits
                                items will work with all weapons.
                                (The skill effect does not depend on how heavy
                                exactly the weapon is, as long as it's not
                                above 10.0 lb, so that weight threshold is
                                basically an on/off toggle for the skill to
                                apply to your attacks.)
                                Also, Critical-strike skill will not give you
                                any benefits if your armour is so heavy that
                                you get a flexibility warning (compare (5.5)).

                                NOTES ABOUT CRITICAL HITS IN GENERAL:
                                You can always score critical hits,
                                independent on weapon class and crit-skill.
                                Martial artists can score critical hits too,
                                although the Critical-strike skill won't do
                                anything for them (it only helps light SWORDS
                                not heavier than 10.0 lb).
                                The probability to land a critical hit will be
                                small though, if you don't have +critical hit
                                items or this skill to help out. Critical hit
                                bonus on items counts slightly more than the
                                skill.
                                Crit boni on weapons only apply to the weapon
                                itself, while bonus on other items such as
                                gloves or rings count for all kind of attacks.
                                (Same goes for slaying/brand mods on items by
                                the way.)
                                For weapon users, the weight of their weapon
                                affects their critical hits:
                                If your weapon is lighter than 10.0 lb, your
                                chances to score a critical hit will further
                                increase. (However, that increase is much
                                smaller than the effects of this skill or of
                                items that give 'Critical Hits' bonus.)
                                Above 10.0 lb, the chance to hit your target
                                critically won't be worse than with a 10.0 lb
                                weapon.
                                Although your chance of hitting critical spots
                                is better with lighter weapons, the damage of
                                your critical strike -IF you manage to execute
                                one- is higher if your weapon is heavier
                                (in detail: the crit class is more likely
                                to be higher for heavier weapons). This effect
                                of getting bigger crits in if the weapon is
                                heavier has no upper weight boundary, so it is
                                true for all weapons up to Grond.
                                Although Critical-strike skill (if applied) and
                                'Critical Hits' bonus from items will also
                                (about equally) improve your chances to land a
                                higher-class critical hit, the weapon weight
                                has even somewhat more effect on average on the
                                crit class than either of those two alone.
                                However, for a good improvement in crit-class
                                just from weapon weight alone, the weapon would
                                need to be much heavier than 10.0 lb.

                                Note that 'critical hit' stacks. 'Critical hit'
                                bonus from items will be actually be somewhat
                                subject to diminishing returns (while the skill
                                won't!) but if we neglect this we can roughly
                                say that +2.500 skill results in +1 crit hit.
                                So for example if you have a ring of critical
                                hits (+7) and gloves that give (+4) and also
                                trained this skill to 10.000 (+4) you'll have a
                                total of roughly +15 critical hit bonus.

        .Combat Stances         Allows you to switch between one of three types
                                of combat stance. You need to wield a weapon to
                                use stances, certain restrictions apply and are
                                explained further below.

                                This ability cannot be trained, but it is
                                increased automatically each time your
                                character gains a level.
                                If you attain the status of King, Queen,
                                Emperor or Empress and are at least level 45,
                                you will learn an additional royal rank version
                                of each stance, which is the most powerful
                                version. If you die and lose your title, you
                                won't be able to use the stance either.
                                Only warriors, mimics, paladins and rangers
                                can learn certain stances.
                                On certain skill levels, you will learn a new
                                rank of a stance. A higher ranked stance
                                features more of its benefits and/or less of
                                its drawbacks.

                                Press 'm' to enter one of the combat stances
                                you have learned. You will learn a couple of
                                ranks of three basic combat stances, when you
                                reach a certain character level i.e. skill.
                                Each stance has advantages and disadvantages,
                                those are:

                                Balanced stance  - the default, no boni/mali.

                                Defensive stance - you will block more,
                                                 - reduce the effect of most
                                                   combat-induced stun effects
                                                   (and possibly some others),
                                                 - intercept less often,
                                                 - deal less damage.
                                                 Note: You can use it even
                                                 without shield - in that case
                                                 your chance of parrying is
                                                 increased instead of blocking.

                                Offensive stance - you can stun opponents
                                                   depending on your strength,
                                                   your 'Weaponmastery' skill
                                                   and your opponent
                                                   (see (4.12) about stunning),
                                                 - intercept more often,
                                                 - parry and dodge only rarely,
                                                 - get an AC penalty same as
                                                   for being in 'fury'.
                                                 Note: You must wield a weapon
                                                 that is not too small to be
                                                 gripped with both hands
                                                 (COULD2H, SHOULD2H, MUST2H).

                                (Note: Switching your combat stance costs you
                                half a turn of energy.)

        .Dual-wield             The ability to wield two weapons at once. This
                                ability cannot be trained, it's always at 1.000
                                if your character's class can dual-wield, else
                                at zero. (So it's basically a switch.)
                                Classes that are able to dual-wield are
                                warriors, rangers and rogues.
                                Note that both weapons must be 1-handed.
                                1,5- or 2-handed weapons cannot be used.

                                Dual-wielding will give you additional parry
                                chance as well as a blows/round bonus
                                (see (6.11) for details about parrying), and of
                                course your character will gain all magical
                                boni from both weapons (such as resistances).

                                NOTE: If your armour is too heavy (see (5.5))
                                then you won't receive any bonus and your
                                second weapon will actually be ignored as if
                                you didn't wield it at all ie you won't gain
                                any resistances/abilities/whatever from it.

                                In combat, a coin is flipped for each blow you
                                deal, determining randomly which weapon will
                                be used for that particular hit.

                                To avoid confusion: If you use weapons with
                                different blows/round, their bpr will get
                                averaged, and rounded up, then bpr bonus for
                                dual-wielding is added.
                                Example: 4bpr & 5bpr = 4.5bpr rounded to 5bpr.
                                +1 bonus bpr for dual-wielding -> 6bpr total.

                                By pressing 'm' you can disable/reenable
                                dual-wield mode.
                                While disabled ('Main-Hand mode') you will just
                                attack with your primary weapon exclusively,
                                and not receive any dual-wield specific boni;
                                this can be useful if it deals much more damage
                                than your secondary weapon.
                                You still gain all magical boni from both
                                weapons while in main-hand mode, as usual.
                                While enabled ('Dual-hand mode') you will
                                attack with both weapons, picked randomly.

    .Martial Arts               Ability to fight with bare hands.
                                Martial Arts users do not and cannot wield any
                                weapons or they get penalised heavily, except
                                for boomerangs.

                                They also get an armour class bonus for each
                                _unused_ equipment slot that can take a piece
                                of armour. Until the skill has been trained
                                quite a bit, armour will rather encumber them
                                instead of help. For this reason, martial
                                artists only wear very light armour or no
                                armour at all in the beginning and do not need
                                to rely on armour during the early game.

                                Slightly raises your character's speed and
                                stealth by +1 for every 10.000 skill increase -
                                the increase might be less or even zero if you
                                are encumbered in some way.

                                Increases your chance of intercepting an enemy.
                                The effectiveness is about 1/4 of what you get
                                out of training the 'Interception' skill.
                                If you train both, their effect will stack.

                                In addition to that, training Martial Arts will
                                provide a base interception chance if you don't
                                have the Interception skill available on a
                                character (see 'Interception' skill). These two
                                interception gains from Martial Arts skill add
                                up. (If you do have the Interception skill
                                available, you get a base interception chance
                                depending on your character level instead, to
                                which again the Martial Arts interception bonus
                                gets added. So you're gaining the same total
                                interception chance in both cases, as long as
                                you keep Martial Arts at maximum possible.)

                                Slightly increases your Dodging skill, simply
                                by increasing your Martial Arts skill, as if
                                'Dodging' was a parent skill of Martial Arts.

                                Lets you attack with special combat styles.
                                You get +1 extra attack at 1,10,20,30,40,45,50
                                each, so up to +7 blows per round in total.

                                At 10 you receive Feather Falling.
                                At 15 your character gets fear resistance.
                                At 20 your character gets confusion resistance.
                                Gives you 'Free Action' (immunity to paralysis)
                                at skill level 25.
                                At 30 you're able to swim without problems.
                                At 40 your movement is perfected enough to
                                cross even highest mountains.
                                At 50 a martial artist will learn the
                                technique of levitation!

                                The dice of martial arts special moves
                                (which your character will use automatically
                                depending on your MA skill) are affected by
                                elemental brands, but slightly less than
                                normal weapons (2/3 as much).
                                Martial arts moves can have high damage dice
                                of up to 8d7. Some moves have special effects
                                such as slowing or stunning your opponent.
                                Your character will use his martial arts moves
                                automatically and somewhat randomly, but mostly
                                choose the most powerful moves available.

                                Under certain conditions (encumberment) MA
                                abilities cannot be used and lose their effect.
                                About this and for more information about
                                Martial Arts in general, see (5.3a)!

    .Interception               Ability to interfere with adjacent enemies.
                                Can prevent them from teleporting, casting,
                                summoning, running away.
                                The monster must be standing right beside you
                                (horizontally, vertically or diagonally).

                                All characters that are able to train this
                                skill or that have trained Martial Arts skill
                                actually gain a base interception chance:
                                If they are able to train Interception then
                                that base chance will depend on their character
                                level. If they don't have Interception skill
                                available then it will depend on their Martial
                                Arts skill level instead (capped to their
                                character level).
                                Actually training the Interception skill will
                                then further add to that base chance.

                                The higher base level the monster has (rlevel)
                                the harder it is to intercept it.
                                Also, interception chance is recuded greatly
                                while you are blind and you aren't able to
                                intercept at all while you are
                                stunned, confused, paralyed, resting, cloaked
                                or shadow running (compare (4.11)).
                                Player ghosts cannot intercept either.

                                Interception works best to prevent shooting a
                                ranged weapon. It's slightly harder to prevent
                                a monster from running away or casting a spell
                                and even somewhat harder to prevent a monster
                                from teleporting or blinking.
                                Some abilities cannot be intercepted at all:
                                Shrieking, unmagic, shooting missiles/rockets,
                                throwing boulders, breathing.

                                Note that multiple players trying to intercept
                                the same monster does not result in 'stacking'
                                of their interception chances:
                                The player who has (under given circumstances
                                such as being blinded etc) the best chance to
                                intercept will override the others.

                                Regarding spell suppression, interception
                                combines with Anti-magic in a special way, see
                                'Anti-magic' skill for details.

    +Archery                    Improves ranged to-damage bonus somewhat, by +1
                                for every 5.000 increase in skill.
                                Also increases 'Bows/Throws' ability somewhat,
                                which in turn further increases hit chance.

                                Allows you to learn some shooting techniques
                                and the ability to craft ammunition,
                                accessible via 'm', see (6.12) for details.

                                Increases your chance to score critical hits.

                                At 20 the quality of your handmade ammunition
                                becomes remarkably better.

                                Lets you pseudo-id ranged weapons and
                                ammunition more often the higher the skill.
                                If increased to at least 11, pseudo-id will
                                give you much more distinctive feelings about
                                the items. Before that, you can only
                                distinguish between cursed and good.

        .Sling-mastery          Increases hit chance (while using a sling) by
                                +1 for every 2.000 skill increase.
                                Also increases Bows/Throws ability somewhat,
                                which in turn further increases hit chance.

                                At 10,20,30,40,50 you will get +1 additional
                                shot per round each (while using a sling).

                                Also reduces the chance of your sling
                                ammunition to shatter by up to 90% at 50.
                                Example:
                                a shot that usually has 10% chance of breaking
                                will only have a 1% chance of breaking if your
                                skill is at 50.000.

                                At 50 you will get an additional bonus of
                                +1 extra might.

                                Artifact ammunition never breaks.

                                Note that the explosion of exploding ammo will
                                still hit "reflecting" monsters.

                                Slings only (does not apply to bow- or xbow-
                                mastery):
                                Adds chance for your shots to ricochet, even
                                multiple times, hitting multiple enemies.
                                Note that magic and ethereal ammo fades away
                                the moment it hits, and never ricochets.

        .Bow-mastery            At 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 you will get +1 extra
                                shot per round each.
                                Otherwise same as Sling-mastery, except no
                                ricochetting.

        .Crossbow-mastery       At 25 and 50 you will get +1 extra shot,
                                at 12.5 and 37.5 you will get +1 extra might.
                                Otherwise same as Sling-mastery, except no
                                ricochetting.

    .Boomerang-mastery          At 16.6, 33.3 and 50 you get +1 extra throw.

                                Increases ranged to-damage bonus when wielding
                                a boomerang by +1 for every 2.500 increase.

                                Reduces the chance of a boomerang to break or
                                to fall to the ground instead of returning.

                                Artifact boomerangs never break or fall down.

   Most spells will increase in power in one way or the other when you increase
   their school skill. Often their failure rate decreases, too. >>

+Magic                          Increases your base mana by +4 per point.

                                Lets you pseudo-id magic items, potions and
                                scrolls faster the higher your skill is.

                                If 'Magic' is at least at 11 points, you will
                                get more distinctive feelings from pseudo-id,
                                before that you only sense 'good' or 'cursed'.

                                At 50, it will raise spell levels by 40%.
                                (It won't raise the level of spells which you

    +Blood Magic                Blood magic doesn't require mana and doesn't
                                provide spells unlike most other magic schools.
                                Instead it provides passive or innate powers
                                that are fueled by your own blood to work.

        .Necromancy             Drains life and mana from killed monsters,
                                replenishing your HP and MP.
                                Only works if you are able to see the target,
                                and if you are not a player-ghost.
                                The amount of points gained depends on the
                                skill and the target's level. To get maximum
                                drain, the skill should be at least half as
                                high as the monster level.
                                Necromancy has no effect on undead and
                                nonliving monsters.
                                At 50.000 the character gains ultimate hold
                                on his life force, rendering him immune to
                                experience drain.

                                A natural vampire race character who has both
                                Necromancy and Traumaturgy at 25.000 or higher
                                will get his intrinsic melee vampirism drain
                                rate increased from the usual 50% by +1% for
                                each further point in either school, up to
                                100% when both schools reach 50.000.

        .Traumaturgy            Drains mana from monsters when you inflict
                                damage on them, replenishing your MP.
                                Only works if you are able to see the target.
                                The amount of points gained depends linearly
                                on your skill level and also somewhat on the
                                damage you inflicted.
                                Even if your inflicted damage and/or skill
                                level is rather low, each attack still has a
                                (small) chance of replenishing at least 1 MP.
                                Traumaturgy is most effective with spells that
                                have an area of effect and can therefore hit
                                multiple monsters, such as balls and especially
                                clouds.
                                Traumaturgy has no effect on angels, undead,
                                and nonliving (constructs) monsters.

                                A natural vampire race character who has both
                                Necromancy and Traumaturgy at 25.000 or higher
                                will get his intrinsic melee vampirism drain
                                rate increased from the usual 50% by +1% for
                                each further point in either school, up to
                                100% when both schools reach 50.000.

        .Aura of Fear           Monsters that hit you are stroke by fear.
                                Undead and non-living monsters and those that
                                resist fear (NO_FEAR) are not affected.
                                The chance for the aura to trigger depends on
                                your skill alone. Whether it has effect on your
                                foe or not only depends on its rlevel compared
                                to your skill - uniques and powerful monsters
                                receive a small bonus in their favour.
                                It is automatically enabled when you train the
                                skill; you can disable the aura in 'm' menu.
                                Being blood magic, auras will feed from your
                                blood. This means that the speed of your hit
                                point regeneration will be reduced while the
                                aura is active.
                                If your skill is at least 20.000 you obtain
                                fear resistance.

        .Shivering Aura         Monsters that hit you are stunned.
                                Monsters that are immune to cold and those that
                                resist stun (NO_STUN) are not affected.
                                The chance for the aura to trigger depends on
                                your skill alone. Whether it has effect on your
                                foe or not only depends on its rlevel compared
                                to your skill - uniques receive a small bonus
                                in their favour.
                                At a skill of 30 the aura is so strong that
                                your melee attacks (weapon as well as martial
                                arts will be branded by it (cold brand).
                                It is automatically enabled when you train the
                                skill; you can disable the aura in 'm' menu.
                                Being blood magic, auras will feed from your
                                blood. This means that the speed of your hit
                                point regeneration will be reduced while the
                                aura is active.

        .Aura of Death          Monsters that hit you are hit by waves
                                of plasma and ice, alternating randomly.
                                The chance for the aura to trigger depends on
                                your skill alone.
                                At a skill of 40 the aura is so strong that
                                your melee attacks (weapon as well as martial
                                arts) will be branded by it (alternating fire
                                or cold brand).
                                It is automatically enabled when you train the
                                skill; you can disable the aura in 'm' menu.
                                Being blood magic, auras will feed from your
                                blood. This means that the speed of your hit
                                point regeneration will be reduced while the
                                aura is active.

    .Mimicry                    Ability to shapechange into a monster!
                                To learn a monster form you must kill an amount
                                of it equal to its level, while your Mimicry
                                skill must be at least half as high as the
                                monster level for you to get credit.

                                Example: To learn Uruk form, you need to kill
                                16 Uruks because Uruk is a level 16 monster
                                (see ~7 for monster lore to check level) and
                                your Mimicry skill must be at least 8 while you
                                kill them, or you won't gain any knowledge.

                                You also inherit the monsters abilities,
                                weaknesses and resistances!

                                See section (6.7) for more info.
                                To find out details about a monster form,
                                press  ~ 7  in game or consult a spoiler file.
                                (See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)

                                For each point that Mimicry is trained above
                                30.000 the character's mana pool will expand
                                by an extra +5 MP (so up to +100 MP at 50.000).

                                The further Mimicry is trained above 35.000
                                the faster a player can shapechange. Usually it
                                takes a full turn to change into another form
                                (or back to player form), but each point above
                                35.000 will cut this down by 5%, so at 50.000
                                Mimicry shapechanging will only take 1/4 turn.

    .Magic Device               Mainly reduces fail chance when trying to use
                                magic devices (wands, staves, rods, activatable
                                items - see (5.9a)), increases their power and
                                speeds up recharging of rods you carry.
                                See (6.10) for more information on magic
                                devices, the skill and the ability.

.Anti-magic                     Generated from your strong disbelief in magic
                                an anti-magic field surrounds you, preventing
                                nearby monsters and players from casting
                                spells (but does not prevent them from using
                                magic devices).
                                This effect is cumulative with the anti-magic
                                field of a Dark Sword. (See (5.9) for more info
                                about dark swords.)
                                It's capped at 75% chance of interrupting
                                enemy spells. The capped chance is further
                                quartered for party members, so they are hardly
                                affected by your anti-magic field. Usage of
                                magic devices by party members is not hindered.
                                The radius of your anti-magic field is approx.
                                the field's power / 9 and caps at range 9.
                                Each point in Anti-magic adds 1% to your
                                AM chance, so the max gain is +50% from skill.
                                If you use a dark sword that gives the maximum
                                amount of anti-magic they can give (+30%) then
                                you only need Anti-magic skill at 45 instead of
                                50 to reach the anti-magic cap value of 75%
                                (30% from dark sword + 45% from skill = 75%).
                                Note: While ball/bolt attacks are spells,
                                      breathing is NOT.
                                Warriors that specialize in Anti-magic are
                                called 'Unbelievers' (The anti-magic powers
                                result from their strong disbelief in magic).

                                Note that as soon as you invest a point into
                                this skill you won't be able to use any spells
                                or magic devices (wands, staves, rods, items
                                that can be activated) anymore!
                                Being anti-magic still allows you to use
                                scrolls and potions though.

                                Training the Anti-magic skill will shorten the
                                duration of certain magical temporary buffs
                                and debuffs on your character, which are:
                                ESP, space/time anchor, probability travel,
                                wraithform, infra-vision, see invisible,
                                invisibilty, haste, slowness, resistances,
                                invulnerability obtained from a potion,
                                deflection, shield.

                                Regarding spell suppression, Anti-magic fields
                                combine with interception in a special way:
                                The total chance to suppress a monster's
                                attempt to cast a spell will yield diminishing
                                returns if the monster's attempt gets hindered
                                by both, Interception and Anti-magic. This
                                means that having high values in both,
                                Interception and Anti-magic, will still give
                                benefits for spell suppression, but the total
                                chance of suppression that results from
                                applying both to a single spell casting attempt
                                will actually come out somewhat reduced.

+Sneakiness                     Slightly increases your character speed
                                (+7 at 50, so approx +1 every 7..8 points).
                                Slightly increases perception and searching.
                                Slightly reduces speed loss while in searching
                                mode, and very slightly while in rogues'
                                cloaking mode.

    .Stealth                    Increases your stealth, which determines
                                if monsters can hear you from a distance
                                or if you can sneak past them.
                                The stealth gain is half as much as from items
                                that give +Stealth.

                                If your character is really bad at stealth,
                                like Draconians, it might seem as if the skill
                                doesn't help. But if you invest a lot of points
                                you will eventually see an improvement ;).

    .Stealing                   Ability to steal items from stores.
                                If you get caught, you will be on the
                                'blacklist of merchants' for a minute up
                                to 2 hours, depending on the item you tried to
                                steal from a shop. During this time it's
                                impossible to steal, and you will get BAD
                                prices (blackmarket-like) in shops.
                                You'll also be on the 'watchlist', meaning
                                that you can shop normally, but are unable to
                                steal until the shopkeepers stop to watch you
                                so intensely. The watchlist runs out slower
                                than the blacklist.
                                The time period you'll be on these lists solely
                                depends on the item's _base_ value (so it does
                                not matter whether you got caught in a normal
                                store or in the black market.) Price discount
                                applies though, reducing the base value and
                                therefore the blacklist time too.

                                Blacklist times, very roughly:
                                Murderous look - 1 hour +
                                Gazes at you angrily - 40 min +
                                Looks at you suspiciously - 25 min +
                                Looks at you disapprovingly - 10 min +
                                Cool glance - less than 10 min.

                                Note that usually people don't want to be seen
                                with stolen goods, which means that very
                                expensive items, depending on their value, have
                                a certain chance of their level becoming 0,
                                making them untradable. (Note: Even if you were
                                stealing Morgoth's crown, which has a value of
                                10 million Au, you'd still have at least a 5%
                                chance of it retaining its original level.)

                                Your chance to steal an item from a shop
                                depends on your dexterity, your stealing skill
                                and the price and weight of the item. Stealth
                                and invisibility are also somewhat helpful.
                                For example it's nearly impossible to steal a
                                large piece of wood without the store owner
                                noticing it, although it's not worth much.
                                There's always a minimum chance of 5% to fail.
                                You need to be at least level 5 to steal
                                and at least level 10 to steal anything of
                                somewhat higher value.

                                You have a chance to successfully steal an
                                item even if your stealing skill is 0 and your
                                dexterity low, so everyone could give it a try.

                                If a shop offers an item more expensive than
                                it actually is (black market) that has no
                                effect on stealing. The 'normal' item value
                                is used to calculate the chances.
                                However, if an item is offered at reduced
                                price, it'll be easier to steal it!

                                It's more difficult to steal from certain
                                stores, eg stores that are found in the dungeon
                                or that don't belong to the basic town stores
                                (numbered 1-9, including the rune repository).
                                It is even impossible to steal from expensive
                                black market (the one located somewhat hidden
                                in Minas Anor), secret black market (the one
                                you can only find in dungeons), rare footwear
                                shop and rare jewelry shop (both in dungeons),
                                or from a dungeon town's temple, potion store
                                or black market.

                                It's a good idea to wear as many +DEX items
                                as possible while trying to steal from a shop,
                                since DEX is the main factor besides the skill.

                                Stealing items which have a base value (without
                                discount applied!) not higher than your
                                stealing_skill * 10 (eg 50 Au->5.000 Stealing)
                                are especially easy to steal.
                                Also, if you still get caught on such an item,
                                the blacklist time will be much shorter too.
                                Some potion/scroll break points regarding this:
                                ?Identify: 50 Au.
                                !Cure Critical Wounds: 100 Au.
                                ?Enchant Weapon/Armour: 125 Au.
                                !Speed: 200 Au.
                                !Restore stat: 300 Au.
                                !Healing, ?Teleportation: 400 Au.
                                !Resistance, !Restore Mana, ,Athelas: 450 Au.
                                ?Wilderness Mapping: 500 Au.

                                Trying to 'steal back' an item that was already
                                owned by a player, ie an item that has been
                                sold to the shop, is especially hard.

    .Backstabbing               Lets you backstab enemies, afflicting high
                                damage. Works if the opponent is asleep or
                                running away in fear, exposing his back to you.
                                Also works when you are cloaked (only once per
                                monster though, so re-cloaking won't help) or
                                shadow running. Increasing this skill increases
                                the damage your backstab attacks deal.

                                Backstabbing requires sword-type weapons or
                                Martial Arts skill, in which case it transforms
                                into neck-twisting. That means your target must
                                possess a neck, read: A head and a torso.

                                If you dual-wield, you will also dual-backstab
                                if the moster is either asleep, or you perform
                                the attack from cloaking mode or shadow run.
                                Although you'll deal somewhat less damage with
                                each stab, since they are executed both at once
                                you will do more overall damage than with a
                                single weapon.

                                Note: Weapon weight or whether it's 1-h, 1 1/2h
                                or 2h weapon does not matter for backstabbing.

                                Backstab hits and critical hits do not stack.
                                If you roll a critical hit on backstabbing, the
                                damage is compared to what the pure backstab
                                would do and the higher one is used.

                                Vampires will feed especially much from
                                backstabbing a sleeping opponent to death.

    .Dodging                    Ability to evade attacks. In order to get any
                                benefits from doding skill at all, your armour
                                mustn't be too heavy. If it is, you will get a
                                flexibility warning (compare (5.5)).
                                Also, you must not be using a shield.

                                A low dodging skill will already help greatly
                                against monsters of similarly low level, so it
                                is helpful right from the beginning of your
                                character's career.

                                There are various attacks that can be dodged:
                                Melee attacks mostly, bolts, arrows and the
                                likes (both magical and physical) shot by
                                enemies or traps at you. And it slightly helps
                                to dodge rubble coming down during an
                                earthquake.

                                Your actual chance to dodge an attack depends
                                on the total weight you are carrying around
                                with you, where inventory usually weighs most
                                and will encumber you the most.
                                Your equipment also musn't be too heavy,
                                although your weapons are allowed to weigh
                                quite a bit, as long as your armour isn't too
                                encumbering. However, for weapons, armour, and
                                inventory always goes: The lighter, the higher
                                your chances will be.
                                And of course your dodging chance depends on
                                your dodging skill, which (after penalized by
                                the weight of all your stuff) is compared to
                                the opponent's level or trap level.
                                (For dodging monsters, the rlevel (0.4) of that
                                monster type is important. Any additional
                                levels the monster may have gained due to
                                dwelling deeper than usual will not affect
                                your dodge chance.)

                                You can check your average dodging chance
                                against opponents of same level by pressing
                                'm' and choosing "Check dodge chance".
                                Depending on the server version you might see
                                textual descriptions instead of raw numbers:
                                "Almost no chance" means less than 5%,
                                "Slight chance" -> less than 14%,
                                "Significant chance" -> less than 23%,
                                "Good chance" -> less than 30%,
                                "Very good chance" -> less than 40%,
                                otherwise "High chance" (may occur in actual
                                game play if opponent is much lower than you).

                                Against monsters that have way higher level
                                than you, you receive a minor penalty. You can
                                still dodge them quite effectively though.

                                Dodging also gets slightly increased by the
                                "Martial Arts" skill (see above in this skill
                                table).

                                Dodging improves in a linear manner, for
                                example your chance to dodge any monster (of
                                similar or higher level than yourself) is
                                pretty much half as high at 25.000 dodging as
                                at 50.000 dodging.

                                As a rule of thumb, your dodge chance (at maxed
                                dodging skill) will usually cap at 67% for
                                monsters of equal level and at 50% chance for
                                monsters of twice your level.

    .Calmness                   Ability to not get hindered by enemies.
                                Monsters can try to intercept some of your
                                actions, the Calmness skill counters these
                                interception attempts. In detail: Monsters can
                                interfere if they are standing on an adjacent
                                grid (ie right next to you) and if you try to..
                                -shoot with ranged weapons,
                                -use a void jumpgate,
                                -set a monster trap.
                                Calmness does not depend on the enemy's level.

    .Trapping                   Improves your ability to set traps:
                                Gives you a higher chance to successfully
                                place a trap if a monster is close to you and
                                trying to interfere. Also, monsters will have
                                a harder time to discover your traps.
                                Last but not least you learn to optimize your
                                traps for higher damage output.
                                (Note that 'Magic Device' or 'Runecraft' skill
                                have no effect on trap damage output, even if
                                it is loaded with a device or a rune.)
                                See (4.7) for details about monster traps.

                                Trapping also improves your disarming ability,
                                making it safer to pick locks and to disarm
                                traps via the manual disarm command. (The
                                experience you gain from manually disarming
                                traps is not affected by the skill but only by
                                the traps' level).
                                The chance to identify a trap on disarming it
                                will also increase with higher Trapping skill.

                                Last but not least Trapping gives you a chance
                                to salvage a trap kit from any trap when you
                                disarm it!

                                Hint: Inscribe all your trapping components
                                      '!=' for easy auto-pickup.

+Health                         Increases your hit points by 2 for each point.
                                Note that this gain stacks with +LIFE items
                                (compare '+LIFE' in (5.8)).
                                Increases your hit point regeneration rate:
                                 (skill_level * 2)% chance to regenerate 1.5x
                                 the normal amount of HP per turn (stacks with
                                 other regeneration effects and item flag).
                                Increases your stamina regeneration rate.

                                Helps you to recover from temporary stats drain
                                drain, hallucination, blindness, confusion,
                                poison and cuts faster.

                                If you spend 10 points into Health, your
                                sanity will be displayed as a bar.
                                At 20 points you'll get the percentage
                                displayed. At 40 the value will be shown.

                                For mimicry users, Health skill is less
                                effective than for other classes, because the
                                hit point bonus is applied before the player's
                                base hit points and monster form hit points are
                                averaged to calculate the mimic's final amount
                                of hit points in a particular a monster form.

    .Swimming                   Allows you to swim even while carrying more
                                weight and to better protect your items from
                                water.

                                Skill maxes at 01.000, with the ability to
                                swim improving steadily while increasing it.
                                At 0.700 you become able to swim very swiftly
                                if no monsters are within sight, enabling you
                                to 'run' through water.

                                For more details about swimming see (4.15).

    .Climbing                   You need this at 01.000 to be able to climb.

    .Digging                    How well you are able to dig. Also affects
                                your chance to find items (from digging only),
                                and chance for those items to be good or even
                                great, and it affects the amount of cash
                                generated from mining mineral veins.

                                In particular, every 10 digging skill you will
                                have a chance to find an additional pile of
                                cash from mining a treasure vein, up to 6 piles
                                if you're lucky at skill 50.000 (provided your
                                dungeon floor depth is greater than half of
                                your digging skill, otherwise the number of
                                piles is limited to depth/5, eg 5 piles for
                                dungeon level 25, while starting at dungeon
                                level 26 you may uncover the full amount of 6
                                piles if your skill is actually 50.000).

                                Depending on the skill, you might also uncover
                                unusual features such as fountains or
                                staircases or somewhat more often (compared to
                                finding just random items from digging) find
                                chests, runes or heavy material pieces suitable
                                for golem creation.
                                The quality of objects found also depends on
                                your digging skill.

                                Certain tools such as shovels, picks and
                                mattocks will also increase your digging speed
                                greatly (independant of the skill), see (5.9).
                                Also, when hacking through trees and bushes,
                                axes will help a lot and swords somewhat, in
                                case you have no good digging tool at hand.
                                2-handed weapons even more than 1-handed.
                                For hacking away webs or ivy, certain polearms
                                used for slashing (scythes and sickles) may
                                help too, just as well as swords or axes.
                                See (3.4a) for more information on digging
                                tools and (5.20) for technical details on
                                digging.

The abilities Swimming, Digging and Climbing are also granted by items you
can find. Those are for example items that grants you levitation, so you may
just hover across water instead of swimming across. Wands of stone-to-mud will
turn any obstacle to mud that you could dig through, and some boots or a
climbing set might grant you the ability to climb highest mountains. Dwarves
also learn this ability automatically when they reach level 30.

Here is what the numbers mean (we will use the Axe-mastery skill for this
example:

+Combat                         10.500  [0.800]
    +Weaponmastery               5.250  [0.800]
        .Axe-mastery            15.000  [0.500]

As we can see this player has 10.5 skill points in Combat, 5.25 in
Weaponmastery and 15 in Axe-mastery. He just reached a new level and hence
gained 5 skill points. Now he decides to invest them all into Axe-mastery.
He presses <DOWN> key until the Axe-mastery line is selected. Now he presses
<RIGHT> key 5 times to invest all his 5 spare skill points here.
Axe-mastery will be increased by 0.500 points per invested skill point (hence
the [0.500] on the right), leaving him at 17.5 Axe-mastery now.
Since sub-skills always slightly affect their parent skills, Weaponmastery
and Combat will also be raised slightly. The result might look like this:

+Combat                         10.750  [0.800]
    +Weaponmastery               6.250  [0.800]
        .Axe-mastery            17.500  [0.500]


Opposed skills
--------------
Some skills don't go well together, and will have negative influence on each
other when increased, decreasing their opposite!
Take care on the following combinations:
        Weaponmastery   <->     Sorcery
        Archery         <->     Sorcery
        Martial Arts    <->     Sorcery
        Anti-magic      <->     excludes any type of magic and magic devices,
                                including mimicry.
                                However, a mimicking player won't lose his
                                current form on training in Anti-magic.
                                He just won't be able to transform ever again
                                by using his mimic powers.
                                His form CAN still change though, if he is
                                zapped with a wand of polymorph, quaffs a
                                potion of Chauve-Souris, uses Morph Restoration
                                service of a shop or.. dies, three
                                things that he probably wants to avoid at all
                                costs in order to keep his 'final' form.


(6.2a) Maiar skill modifications
--------------------------------
Maiar start with a low-profile skill chart, which gets boosted or diminished
depending on their alignment (enlightened vs corrupted) on initiation.

(Low-profile means that their "good" and "evil" skills - the four holy schools,
necromancy, traumaturgy and the three auras - are all reduced to 70% of the
character classes' usual ratio.)

When a skill's ratio has been modified on initiation, the skill will
automatically be set as close as possible to its previous value, and the extra
skill points will be refunded, so the character does not "lose" any skill
points by training skills prior to initiation.

Skills that become disabled on initiation will not be nulled and hence will
continue to have effect, although the character won't be able to increase them
any further after that.

Modifications for becoming 'enlightened':
  Necromancy, Traumaturgy, aura of death and Shadow become disabled.

  Sword-, Blunt- and Polearm-mastery skill x 1.3.
  The four holy schools x 2.1.
  Spirit school x 2.1.
  Divination school x 1.7.
  Light and Mana runes x 1.7.
  Fear and Shivering Aura x 3.0.

Modifications for becoming 'corrupted':
  The four holy schools and Spirit become disabled.

  Axe-mastery and Martial Arts skill x 1.3.
  Fire, Air, Conveyance school x 1.7.
  Udun school x 2.0.
  Darkness and Nether runes x 1.7.
  Shadow school x 2.1.
  All Blood Magic schools x 3.0.

Note: After a skill's gain ratio has been boosted as stated above, it will be
      capped against a maximum value of 2.000, which cannot be exceeded.



(6.3) Abilities
---------------
Depending on your race and class, you will be better or worse at certain
generic abilities. You can see your abilities in the character screen
(press 'C').

Miscellaneous Abilities can range from Bad to Legendary:
Bad         (red)    (or 'Very Bad' if negative, no real difference)
Poor        (red)
Fair        (yellow)
Good        (light green)
Very good   (light green)
Excellent   (light green)
Superb      (light green)
Heroic      (light green)
Legendary   (light green)

Some of those abilities have a maximum value after which they cannot be
increased any further. Such abilities show 'legendary' in different colours
than just light green. Instead they use:
Legendary   (dark green)    This means it's good enough to deserve being
                            called 'legendary'.
Legendary   (golden)        This means, that you have reached the absolute
                            highest possible value for this ability.


Here is a list of detailed information about miscellaneous abilities:

Fighting
    How well you can fight (hit chance; further boni like skills or +hit from
    equipment are added to the ability) or how easily you get disarmed
    ("You lose the grip of your weapon(s)!").
    (Note that any +tohit bonus increases the displayed Fighting ability:
    The displayed value is the sum of your actual ability and your hit boni.)
Bows/Throw
    How well you can shoot/throw.
    (Note that any +tohit bonus increases the displayed Bows/Throw ability:
    The displayed value is the sum of your actual ability and your hit boni.)
Saving Throw
    How well you can resist attacks that have influence on your status
    other than just hit points (except for monster curses, which can be
    prevented too). Saving throw is rolled (possibly modified) against:
    -Fear and paralysation melee attacks
    -Confusion, fear, blindness, slowness, paralysation spell effects
    -Non-friendly teleportation effects
    -All nexus/morph effects (except polymorphing from bat form back to normal)
    -Unmagic effects
    -Direct damage curses (the ones screamed by monsters at you)
    -Suffering damage from dispelling effects
    -Psi attacks of all sorts (damage and effects), including mind-blanking and
     the terribly adverse effects of an encounter with an eldritch horror,
     which can be: Confusion, hallucination, insanity, paralyzation, amnesia
     and (sometimes permanent) loss of intelligence and wisdom.
    -The draining effects of an ancient foul curse (TY_CURSE)
    -Seasoned traveller trap effect.
Stealth
    Determines if monsters will immediately wake up if you're nearby or if
    you are able to sneak past sleeping monsters without waking them.
Perception
    Determines how often you have a chance to spot hidden traps or doors on
    adjacent fields without even searching for them. Whether you really
    discover something will depend on your Searching ability.
Searching
    Determines how easily you spot hidden traps/doors on adjacent fields
    while searching for them (with 's' or 'S'), or when you automatically
    notice them due to your Perception ability.
Disarming
    How well you can disarm traps (without setting them off), and how likely
    you avoid known traps if you accidentally step on them again.
    (Note that manually disarming traps like this will yield experience points
    if successful, while disarming via magic or magic devices won't.)
Magic Device
    How well you can use magic items like wands, staves, rods (these are often
    especially hard to use) or activate magic items like Dragon Scale Mails.
    See (6.10) for more information.

Blows/Round
    How often per round you are able to strike with your weapon. This depends
    on your strength, dexterity, your class, your weapon.
    Spending points in specific weapon masteries will give you an additional
    blow at 25 and at 50 (like Sword- or Blunt-mastery).
    Tables of blows/round limits are at (5.3a) for Martial Arts, and at (6.5)
    and (6.5a) for melee weapons.
Shots/Round
    How often per round you are able to use your ranged weapon.
    Spending points into specific archery skills will give you additional shots
    (see (6.2) for details).
    Mimics may get additional shots per round if the monster form they use has
    the ability to shoot with ranged weapons (see (6.7) for details).
Infra-Vision
    How far you can see warm-blooded monsters in the dark.
    10 ft equal a distance of 1 field.
    IV can be very helpful for spotting monsters outside of your light radius
    that don't carry a light source themselves.

These miscellaneous abilities can also change when your character progresses,
depending on your +hit and +dam (concerning Fighting and Bows/Throws) or your
character level or certain skills you invest points into.
How much an ability changes when a property of your character (skill, level or
weapon enchantments) it depends on changes, depends on your class: The relative
numerical modifiers are given in the class table in (6.5).
Here is a list which ability changes depend on which factors:
(The factors in relation to the values in (6.5) are marked by underscores.
All other factors listed here are further modifications, independant of (6.5).)

Fighting        _'Combat'_, _'Weaponmastery'_, melee +hit boni
Bows/Throw      _'Combat'_, _'Archery'_, ranged +hit boni
Saving Throw    Wisdom, _level_, AM-shell
Stealth         Mimic form weight, stealth items, _'Stealth'_, cloaking,
                'Martial Arts'
Perception      search items, _'Sneakiness'_
Searching       search items, _'Sneakiness'_, cloaking
Disarming       Intelligence, dexterity, _'Trapping'_
Magic Device    Intelligence, _'Magic Device'_


For age, height, weight, social class and gender see (6.14).


Apart from those generic abilities, there are several class- or race-specific
active or passive abilities, given in the race/class descriptions in (6.4) and
(6.5).



(6.4) Races
-----------
Depending on your race, you might need different amounts of experience to gain
a new character level. You also might have certain intrinsic abilities.

For Beginners a powerful yet simple race/class combination like Half-Troll,
Half-Orc or Dwarven Warrior is strongly recommended. (Warrior being by far the
most straight-forward and most forgiving class in the beginning.)

The Maia race is not recommended for beginners due to its complexity.

The Yeek race is not recommended for beginners because it's extraordinarily
weak in all fields (its only upside being that it needs the least amount of
experience of all races to gain levels).

The Vampire race is not necessarily recommended for beginners due to its
various quirks that you'll need to pay attention to (feeding, light sources,
certain healing/curing effects that instead damage vampires).


List of all races (make sure to read the paragraph about your race, when you
create a character!):
---------------------

- Human
    Humans are allrounders with no special weaknesses or strengths.
    Humans have no experience penalties and tend to go up levels faster than
    most other races. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters
    choosing human.
    Humans get a bonus on 'Climbing', a slight bonus on 'Climbing' and a large
    bonus on 'Interception'.

- Half-Elf
    Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans, but not as strong.
    Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming, saving throws,
    stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
    Half-elves resist light intrinsically.
    They get bonus on 'Bow-mastery' and 'Interception', a small bonus on
    the 'Nature' and 'Spirit' and a small malus on the 'Shadow' school.

- Elf
    Elves resist light effects intrinsically and see invisible creatures.
    Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at fighting.
    They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans or half-elves and
    also have better wisdom.
    Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and
    magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
    Elves get bonus on 'Bow-mastery', 'Magic', 'Stealth', 'Dodging',
    'Calmness', 'Sneakiness' and the magic 'Water' and occult 'Spirit' schools,
    a large bonus on the magic 'Nature' school and a malus on 'Shadow'.

- Hobbit
    Hobbits have their dexterity sustained. Further, they get a dexterity bonus
    from not wearing shoes! Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at shooting,
    throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching
    disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but
    prefer to be called burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good
    at melee fighting. Halflings have fair infra-vision, so they can detect
    warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Hobbits resist black breath somewhat.
    They get bonus on 'Sling-mastery', 'Sneakiness', 'Dodging' and a large
    bonus on 'Stealth'.

    Note:
    Since hobbits have low hit points you might consider training the skill
    'Health' to make up for it, depending on which class you choose to play.

- Gnome
    Gnomes are intrinsically protected to paralysis effects. Gnomes are smaller
    than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the hobbits, live in the
    earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent Warlocks & Sorcerers, and
    have very good saving throws. They are good at magic, searching, disarming,
    perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans so they are
    not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision,
    so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance.
    Gnomes receive bonus on 'Crossbow-mastery' and 'Magic' and a large bonus on
    'Dodging' and 'Digging'.

- Dwarf
    Dwarves can never be blinded and at level 30 they learn to travel across
    even the highest mountain regions.
    Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons
    are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior
    or priest. Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less
    intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat
    wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very
    good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one big
    drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud
    voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, and screaming out
    challenges at nearby foes. In other words, dwarves have a miserable
    stealth. They receive a bonus on 'Axe-mastery' and 'Climbing' and a huge
    bonus on 'Digging'.

- Half-Orc
    Because of their preference to living underground to on the surface,
    Half-orcs resist darkness intrinsically. They make excellent warriors and
    decent priests, but aren't good at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at
    stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs
    are quite ugly, and tend to pay more for goods in town. Half-Orcs do make
    good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to
    have great constitutions and lots of hit points.
    They get a slight bonus on 'Backstabbing', a large bonus on 'Weaponmastery'
    and a bonus on 'Necromancy' and occult 'Shadow' magic and receive penalties
    on 'Magic', 'Sorcery' and 'Spirit' and a slight penalty on 'Swimming'.

- Half-Troll
    Half-trolls have their strength sustained. They are very strong, but also
    very stupid and slow. They make great warriors and iffy priests. They are
    bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly
    that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. They need to eat often but
    they also regenerate hit point especially quickly (same as if wearing an
    item providing regeneration, doesn't stack with item ability). Thanks to
    their thick skin, they also get an (albeit very small) bonus to armour
    class. Half-Trolls get bonus on 'Blunt-mastery', 'Health'. They receive a
    penalty on 'Critical-strike' and 'Swimming' and large penalties on
    'Climbing', 'Swimming', 'Archery', 'Magic' and 'Sorcery'.

- Dunadan
    Dunadain have their constitution sustained. Dunadain are a race of hardy
    men from the West. This elder race surpasses human abilities in every
    field, especially constitution. However, being men of the world, very
    little is new to them, and levels are very hard for them to gain.
    A Dunadan gets bonus on 'Combat', 'Archery' and 'Interception' and a small
    bonus to 'Magic' and 'Swimming'.

- High-Elf
    High-Elves can see the invisible and resist light and the flow of time
    intrinsically. They are a race of immortal beings dating from the
    beginning of time, masters of all skills, strong and intelligent, although
    their wisdom is sometimes suspect. They do very well in all professions.
    There are few things that they have not seen already, and experience is
    hard for them to gain.
    High-Elves receive boni on 'Bow-mastery', 'Magic', 'Stealth', 'Dodging'
    and the magic 'Nature' school, a large bonus on 'Calmness', a slight
    bonus on 'Swimming' and on occult 'Spirit' magic and a malus on 'Shadow'.

- Yeek
    Being weak and losing many childhood fights, they have learned the
    ability to float gently to the ground. They have intrinsic feather
    falling.
    Often having to escape from precarious situations, yeeks are able to pass
    through dense forest quickly.
    Yeeks are the least powerful of all the races. They suffer disadvantages
    in all stats and have attributes similar to humans. However, to
    compensate Yeeks learn, and thus gain levels, extremely quickly.
    Yeeks don't receive boni or mali on any skills except that they are good at
    'Swimming'.

    Note:
    Since yeeks have low hit points you might consider training the skill
    'Health' to make up for it, depending on which class you choose to play.

- Goblin
    Goblins have a decidedly mixed reputation. They are almost always grinning,
    and more often than not you cannot tell whether or not they are eyeing you
    like a side of meat. They are as sturdy as Dwarves and are quite agile
    making them good fighters, rogues, and mimics. Being creatures of the
    night, Goblins have natural resistance to darkness.
    They receive bonus on 'Boomerang-mastery', 'Stealing' and occult 'Shadow'
    magic and a malus to 'Spirit' and all four holy schools.

- Ent
    The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world,
    eldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the
    land, they were summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth.
    Being much like trees they are very slow but strong and do not have
    to eat as often. Because they consist of wood, they are quite
    susceptible to fire and they don't drown in water. As the Shepherds
    of the Trees, they can learn to sense the presence of others, such
    as animals  at level 10, orcs at 15, trolls at 20, giants at 25,
    dragons at 30, demons at 40 and all evil-minded creatures at level 50.
    At level 4 Ents learn to see invisible things. In general, they accumulate
    experience very slowly and they do not eat normal food but they are able to
    consume liquids. Trees will slightly bend aside to let ents pass through.
    Ents are able to slowly replenish their nourishment by rooting themselves
    into the ground by entering 'R'esting mode, provided it's natural ground
    such as grass, earth, mud or water. Their food state will go up to 'Full'
    that way. They cannot eat normal food but will feed greatly from drinking
    potions that provide nourishment. They can never be gorged though.
    Ents intrinsically resist the force of unleashed water and their bark skin
    provides a small bonus to armour class.
    They get bonus to 'Health', a slight bonus to 'Spirit' and a large bonus on
    'Calmness' and on the magic schools 'Earth', 'Water' and 'Nature'. They
    receive a large penalty on 'Fire' school, a penalty on 'Axe-mastery' and a
    small penalty on 'Sword-mastery'. They cannot train 'Climbing' at all.

- Draconian
    These humanoid half-breeds of dragon and man surpass common humans in all
    ways, except that they are really bad at moving stealthily. Similar to
    dragons, they can eat firestones to temporarily boost their powers.
    (See (5.9) for firestone details.)
    Draconians need a very long time to gain further experience and need to eat
    often. They have feather falling instrinsically from birth.
    At level 5 they can spot dragons anywhere on the level. At level 6 they
    acquire an intrinsic telepathic vision of all nearby creatures, the radius
    expands as they gain levels. At level 30 they learn how to levitate.
    Unlike other races, draconians are susceptible to the void connecting
    void jump gates and may get hurt by it when they travel through it,
    perceiving it as "cold" even if they resist or are immune to normal frost.
    Armour can help to mitigate this effect somewhat.
    Draconians possess a certain lineage trait from birth, providing them with
    intrinsic resistances and an elemental breath (learned at level 8) which
    they can use if they have sufficient stamina (costs 3, accessible with 'm')
    and which is a physical ability of theirs, not a magic spell.
    'Breathe element' inflicts damage equal your current hit points divided by
    3 and capped between 350 and 500 depending on your element, with the basic
    element types doing the most damage and shards and sound doing the least.
    This breath weapon cannot be used while polymorphed, except if the form is
    a reptile (including Hydras) or an actual dragon (including dragonriders).
    The resistances and other abilities obtained from a trait remain active
    even while polymorphed.
    Thanks to their scaly hide they receive a small bonus to armour class,
    especially the metallic lineages - bronze, silver and gold.
    Draconians receive a bonus on 'Attunement', 'Polearm-mastery' and

    Hint: Make sure to set your breath attack to a hotkey when you learn it.

- Kobold
    These somewhat smallish dog-faced humanoids resist poison intrinsically.
    They are able to take most roles, being somewhat better at archery than
    close combat. Their intelligence is somewhat suspect, and although they do
    not pick up careers as mages or other very elaborate professions, they can
    become shamans or druids.
    They can see in the dark thanks to infra-vision, have extraordinarily sharp
    senses, and can move very silently, making them hard to spot. They are also
    good at disarming traps.
    Kobolds receive a bonus on 'Trapping', a large bonus on 'Swimming' and a
    slight bonus on 'Sneakiness'.

- Dark-Elf
    Dark-Elves dwell below the surface in huge caverns of their underground
    city. The children are already drilled to become sworn enemies of most
    other races of the underground, and also of the hated Elves and High-Elves
    who live on the surface under the burning light of the sun. Overthrowing
    rivals by treachery and murder are acknowledged ways in their society,
    as long as noone is left alive who might bring charge against the victors.
    Dark-Elves are good fighters and sorcerors, but also decent priests.
    Dark-Elves intrinsically resist darkness, but are susceptible to light.
    At level 20 they learn to see the invisible.
    They get bonus on 'Stealth', 'Dodging', 'Sneakiness', 'Backstabbing', a
    large bonnus on occult 'Shadow' magic and a malus on all four holy schools
    and the occult 'Spirit' school.

- Vampire
    These powerful undead creatues move out in the night to hunt living prey
    and suck its blood to sustain themselves. Vampires resist darkness, but
    are susceptible to light and certain purifying and anti-evil effects, be it
    on items such as scrolls, on magic devices, or on equipment such as weapons
    and light sources (which may drain their hit points if equipped, even if
    the vampire acquired resistance to light).
    Vampires fear the sun light and any kind of items giving off powerful light
    (radius of 3 or more, artifact lights, or light sources that are blessed,
    evil-slaying or undead-slaying). Asides from light sources aside they fear
    all items that are blessed or *slay undead*. Any such item will burn them,
    draining their hit points. Exceptions are cursed lights and items and the
    "Stone of Lore" - these will not harm them.
    They start with a mummy wrapping, because it can protect them from the
    sunlight. If they are moving on the world surface (meaning not in a dungeon
    or tower) while it's day, the sun will burn them if they don't resist light
    or wear a mummy wrapping.
    They don't actually need a light source, since they are able to determine
    their close surroundings even in complete darkness. This ability grows
    when the vampire rises in character-levels, starting at torch-wide radius
    and growing to lantern-wide radius already when reaching level 10.
    Regarding items, Vampires do not suffer a hit point drain from wielding a
    spectral weapon. They are even able to wear or wield heavily cursed items
    such as Morgul weapons and benefit from them, turning their negative boni
    into positive ones! The only exception are weapons of Nothingness, which
    won't do them any good either. Since Vampires are immune to Black Breath,
    using a Morgul weapon will not pose a problem to them.
    Vampires are good fighters and decent mages. However, they are unable to
    conjure holy fire or utilize magic of water or nature school. Neither can
    they make use of mimicry techniques (with the exception of vampire bat,
    see below) or holy or spirit spells. They are unable to try and suppress
    magic, but can make use of items that provide anti-magic effects.
    Aside from darkness they also resist sanity-draining effects (somewhat),
    cold, time, nether, they're immune to poison and it's hard to drain their
    life force - this is also true for life force drained by items a vampire
    has equipped: Those will drain exp at only half the normal rate.
    Vampires have a good chance to resist the adverse effects of encountering
    an eldritch horror (see (6.3) under 'Saving Throw' for details on those).
    They also intrinsically have partially life leeching (vampiric) attacks
    (see '(5.15) Vampirism' for more information) which they can further
    improve by training in both Necromancy and Traumaturgy (see skill details).
    Being undead, vampires don't drown as easily as other races, but the water
    still has a somewhat damaging effect if they cannot swim at all.
    At level 20 they become able to turn into a vampire bat (mimicry code 391).
    Vampire bats are fast, can fly (basically as effective as 'levitation')
    and are more resistant to sun burn than the humanoid vampire form,
    making them useful for travelling, although they move slightly erratically.
    At level 35 they can become able to turn into vampiric mist (mimicry 365).
    In mist form, they can pass closed doors, traps without triggering them,
    have maximum stealth and be granted a shivering aura (or have their
    existing shivering aura boosted). They will also gain the 'invisibility'
    effect (as from items) against monsters, but not against other players.
    (Note: This invisibility effect will not result in the usual purple colour
    of the player's symbol, it's still there though.)
    However, Vampires cannot perform a lot of physical actions in mist form,
    such as fighting, and the creeping mist moves slower than they would in
    their normal form.
    Vampires cannot eat normal food, instead they need to feed off living
    creatures. This means that you need to kill monsters in melee range (though
    not necessarily by using melee attacks - spells or arrows work fine too) in
    order to satisfy your hunger, which might be quite easy for melee classes
    but sometimes a hassle for ranged/caster classes. On the plus side, a
    vampire won't get gorged by drinking too many potions.
    At level 40 they will also start to need less and less food to sustain
    themselves. Vampire royalties will require the least amount of food,
    independant of their level, enabling them to survive a very long time
    without feeding - even an item granting 'Slow Digestion' will not improve
    this any further.
    Vampires hate 'Blunt' weapons, are bad at 'Swimming', get a penalty on
    'Divination' magic school, but receive a bonus on 'Mental Intrusion' and
    a large bonus on 'Shadow', 'Necromancy' and all aura skills and a small
    bonus on 'Traumaturgy'. They cannot use certain magic schools at all as
    described above. As undead, Vampires gain a moderate skill bonus for
    'Nether' runes but in turn find it hard to improve in 'Light' runes.

    Hint: In case you lose your mummy wrapping and the general store doesn't
    have one in stock, you can order one there (press 'o' key in the store).

- Maia
    The Maiar are lesser spirits who are associated with one or more Valar, the
    greater gods. Being of divine origin they can shape themselves in fashion
    of elves or humans as they see fit, often acting as powerful wizards to
    guide elves and man by gaining their trust. Appearing in such shape, their
    abilities will seem somewhat superior in all aspects and they also possess
    infra-vision.

    Maiar have a choice of ascending to enlightenment, or submit to corruption
    of the promise of demonic powers. To determine their fate, they must kill
    either a candlebearer, a servant of good (to become corrupted), or a
    darkling, a harbinger of demonkind (to become enlightened) before reaching
    level 20 or they will lose the ability to stay in the realm and their
    physical form will be destroyed.
    They will also meet such a fate of being destroyed by indecisiveness if
    they kill both of these kind indiscriminately before having reached
    initiation, so take care. After they underwent initiation at level 20, they
    may just kill all of them indiscriminately, same as any other monster.
    Using but their mind they can easily perceive both good and demonkind
    telepathically. The servants and harbingers of those factions that Maiar
    need to slay occur from dungeon level 12 to 20 (which correspond to
    -600..-1000 ft in dungeon 'Barrow-Downs' for example, since that dungeon
    starts at level 1). In the IDDC, they appear from level 10 to 20.
    If a Maia generates the dungeon level, there will be a guaranteed spawn, so
    if you are in a party with non-Maiar, make sure you are the first one
    taking the staircase so you generate the level.

    Maiar are able to train in the 'Astral' school, an exclusive divine magic
    which has spells of different effect depending on the caster's alignment.
    Some astral spells use intelligence for determining their spell failure
    rates, some use wisdom.
    Initiation to either enlightened or corrupted beings, or during their first
    few character levels the lack thereof, will decide the effect of astral
    spells.
    Maiar can be any class that can utilize mana. They get the best shop prices
    of all races since they are either greatly respected or feared by all other
    creatures.
    They gain experience extremely slowly, and rarely need to feed before
    initiation. Afterwards they have no more need for any worldly food at all
    (and they cannot become gorged either).
    Alignment-dependant boni are..

    Enlightened:
        Able to see invisible and resisting light, while being susceptible to
        evil-based attacks.
        Intrinsic light aura that adds to any light source's radius.
        +1 bonus AC for every 2 levels above 20 (caps at 50).
        At level 50 they will be able to levitate, become resistant to poison,
        electricity, cold and be enveloped in an aura of frost and lightning;
        also, their melee attacks will slay evil opponents intrinsically.
        Able to almost instantly sense curses on items.

        Necromancy, Traumaturgy, Aura of Death and Shadow become disabled.
        Sword-, Blunt- and Polearm-mastery skill x 1.3.
        The four holy schools x 2.1, Spirit x 2.1, Divination x 1.7.
        Light and Mana runes x 1.7, Fear and Shivering Aura x 3.0.

    Corrupted:
        Resist fire and darkness while being susceptible to good-based attacks.
        +2 bonus HP for each level above 20.
        At level 50 they will become resistant to poison, immune to fire, and
        be enveloped in a fiery aura.
        Able to take off lightly cursed items.

        The four holy schools and Spirit become disabled.
        Axe-mastery and Martial Arts skill x 1.3.
        Priests only: Sword-mastery x 1.3.
        Priests and Paladins get Blunt-mastery reset and disabled.
        Fire, Air, Conveyance schools x 1.7, Udun x 2.0, Shadow x 2.1.
        Darkness and Nether runes x 1.7, all Blood Magic schools x 3.0.

    Maiar start with a low profile skill chart which gets boosted on initiation
    depending on their alignment, never exceeding 2.000 though.
    Their skills will be adjusted on initiation so that they remain as close to
    their previous values as possible while the character gets back any skill
    points that are freed up due to higher skill ratios after the initiation
    took place, see (6.2a) for details.

    Maia get a bonus on 'Sneakiness' and 'Stealth' no matter the alignment.

(6.5) Classes/Professions, titles, melee blows/round
----------------------------------------------------
Depending on your class, your start-up equipment and your skill tree will
vary. For example a warrior cannot learn magic spells.

Classes most straight-forward/most forgiving to play for starters are:
 -Warrior
 -Rogue (dual-wielding sword-type weapons makes them powerful early on)
 -Paladin (similarly tough as warriors)
 -Druid (utilise their shapeshifting powers they gain every 5 levels!)
 -Mindcrafter (just make sure to get Psionic Blast spell macroed right away)

Intermediate starting difficulty:
 -Archer (easy when teaming up with a meat shield who keeps monsters at bay)
 -Mimic (mostly plays straight-forward like a warrior, but need to hunt for
         monster forms which can be hard for beginners, especially if they
         don't know much about monsters)
 -Ranger (can do well in many fields such as melee, ranged weapons and spells,
         somewhat similar to an adventurer).

Hardest classes for beginners to play maybe:
 -Adventurer (cause it's a jack of all trades so you can end up mediocre in
             every regard if you don't know what you're doing)
 -Shaman (triple-relation of forms, combat skills and magic spells)
 -Priest (weak in almost all regards the beginning, but great early on party
         asset if he gets the 'Cure Wounds' spell and uses it to heal his party
         members from the back line)
 -Istar (glass cannon in the beginning, so if you are out of mana at the wrong
        time you could die fast)
 -Runemaster (needs some time to get a grip of the spell system, and has not
             that high hit points, ie glass cannonish).


List of all classes (make sure to read the paragraph about your class, when you
create a character!):
---------------------

- Warrior
    A warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
    by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
    a magical device. His prime stats are strength and constitution, and a
    good dexterity can really help at times. Warriors will be good at melee
    and bows, but bad at most other skills. They don't learn any magic but can
    train to use magic devices; also they may dual-wield two one-handed weapons
    at once, although they will need to use light armour for this strategy to
    be effective (see (6.2)).
    Provided his strength is high enough, a two-handed weapon will usually
    be preferable over dual-wielding when a warrior seeks to forego defense to
    maximize damage, because two-handed weapons will still allow the use of
    heavy armour which dual-wielding doesn't.
    Warriors have more melee attacks per round than any other class.
    They may decide to become 'Unbelievers' by spending points irreversibly
    into the 'Anti-magic' skill. As soon as they spend the first point here
    they will immediately become unable to use any magic wand/staff/rod!
    The full opposite of sorcerers, unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
    not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in
    the use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally incompetent when
    trying to use a magic item, although they can still quaff potions and read
    scrolls. Because they are so unattuned to magic, trained unbelievers will
    suppress any sort of magic from occurring around them at high probability,
    which is dubbed 'anti-magic field'. They can further strengthen it by
    wielding a Dark Sword (see (5.9)).
    Warriors can also choose to become monk-like fighters, by training the
    'Martial Arts' skill. This will require them to wear no armour or only very
    light armour later on.
    The warrior class is recommended for beginners because it's forgiving in
    the early game and you can do fine with just a macro for potions of cure
    wounds and maybe also a macro for phase door scrolls until you reach a
    somewhat higher level.

    Hint: On character creation increase your strength to 18/30 at the very
    least to get a decent attack speed (3 blows per round with very light
    weapons). Pick one of the four weapon masteries (Sword/Blunt/Axe/Polearm),
    or Martial Arts if you don't want to use weapons, and always keep it
    maximized!
    Make sure to create a macro for your fighting techniques 'Sprint' and
    'Taunt' when you learn them, which you do pretty early on. They are great
    for catching annoying monsters that try to keep their distance to you.
    (See (6.12) for details about fighting techniques.)

    Dual-wield trick if you lose your items on death:
    If you die and revive, you could save a lot of money by foregoing heavy
    armour for attack power. Just buy some cheap, light armour and two cheap
    and very light 1-handed weapons which you wield both at once (Dual-wield)!
    The lightest weapons of each class are:
    - Daggers (Sword-mastery)
    - Whips (Blunt-mastery)
    - Cleavers (Axe-mastery)
    - Spears (Polearm-mastery)
    Dual-wielding requires light armour. This should be adequate until you find
    some heavy armour in the dungeon, then you can switch back to 1-handed
    weapon with a shield (or to a 2-handed weapon if you have excessive enough
    strength to get at least 2 blows per round with it).
    (For details on the benefits of dual-wielding, see (6.2).)

- Istar (the Quenya word for "mage")
    Istari use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have
    to cast spells and how low their failure rate is.
    They are the all-around best magicians, having both devastating and highly
    useful supportive spells (at least for their own benefit) of very wide
    variety.
    On the downside, they are the worst fighters, being unable to use any
    weapon but a Mage Staff comfortably, and until they learn how to
    effectively use the 'Disruption Shield' spell they are very vulnerable.
    A high-level istar can be very powerful, but getting there can be a
    difficult journey.

    Hint: An istar has very few hit points compared to other classes, making
    survival difficult in the beginning. That's why this class is not
    recommended for beginners.

- Priest
    Priests use certain divine magic, uttered as prayers. Unlike mages they
    have a fair fighting potential with blunt or blessed weapons. If a priest
    wields a blessed weapon he will get his 'Blunt-mastery' skill applied to it
    even if it's not actually a blunt-type weapon.
    Priests can learn many spells that are helpful to their party members. They
    use mainly wisdom for their prayers, determining the amount of mana and how
    low their failure rate is.
    A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
    to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
    fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their church!
    They are very good with magical devices, preferring to call them
    instruments of their god, but are not as good as istari in their use.
    Priests also have excellent saving throws due to divine intervention.
    Although weak in the beginning, they can make decent fighters who strongly
    prefer blunt weapons over edged ones. They are not able to train in edged
    weapons, and if they wield one that isn't blessed, they receive an
    additional severe penalty.
    Priests are especially adept at sensing curses on any sort of item, an
    ability that grows with their character level, perfecting this at level 35
    at which they are able to notice curses almost instantly.
    Wisdom is the priest's primary stat and they get a bonus on 'Holy Curing'.

    Hint: Note that their spell Holy Light can be used to deal decent damage
    after it's been brought up a few levels. Orcs are said to fear it a lot.
    Priests aren't easy to play in the beginning, since they don't deal much
    damage and also can't take a lot of punishment, so they aren't recommended
    for beginners.
    If you're a team player and want to support your team right from the
    beginning, get the spell 'Cure Wounds' as soon as possible and macro it.

    There are rumours of ultimately corrupted priests which have lost all their
    holiness and align with the forces of hell instead.

- Rogue
    A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by cunning, but is capable of
    fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and locks, no
    device is impossible for him to overcome.
    Their primary stats are intelligence and dexterity, intelligence being very
    important if they aim to become proficient at magic, while dexterity makes
    up in combat prowess for what their strength might be lacking.
    Rogues have very high stealth allowing them to sneak around many creatures
    without having to fight, or to sneak up and get the first blow,
    backstabbing his opponent.
    Rogues are especially fond of dual-wielding two light one-handed weapons at
    once (see (6.2). They prefer light armour, since dual-wielding and many of
    their special abilities won't work with heavy armour or two-handed weapons
    (see (5.5)).
    A rogue's perception is higher than any other class, and usually they
    notice traps or secret doors without needing a search. Rarely will a
    rogue be unable to avoid or disarm a trap. Rogues also have the unusual
    ability to train stealing from shops and their fellow men, a dangerous but
    sometimes very rewarding profession.
    Searching (or entering searching mode) will actually search within a radius
    instead of just the adjacent grids, another special trick of this class -
    this way it becomes much easier to find staircases without mapping magic.
    Rogues are better than warriors or paladins with magical devices, but still
    can not rely on their performance. They can also learn a few magic spells.
    When searching for hidden traps, doors and stairs, they may spot them more
    easily, even from a distance, which increases when the rogue gains levels.
    At level 15, rogues will learn another special ability: Cloaking mode.
    (Press 'V' to make your character prepare for cloaking up / uncloaking.)
    By cloaking their physical appearance and body warmth pattern perfectly,
    which takes a certain time to get prepared, they become completely
    untrackable to almost any monster, for exceptions see (0.2).
    Attacking, taking damage (with the exception of floor grid induced damage
    such as fire damage from lava) and a couple of other actions immediately
    break cloaking, again see (0.2) for details.
    Being masters of cloaking, at level 30 they become able to see through any
    similar cloaking or shadowing techniques employed by their opponents
    (monsters only).

    Hint: Make sure to create a macro for your fighting techniques 'Sprint' and
    'Taunt' when you learn them, which you do pretty early on. They are great
    for catching annoying monsters that try to keep their distance to you.
    (See (6.12) for details about fighting techniques.)
    Always keep your Sword-mastery skill at maximum (if you don't go for an
    unusual build that uses Martial Arts instead).

- Mimic
    Mimics are melee fighters who can learn how to shapechange and use the form
    of any monsters (except for unique ones) they slay, thereby inheriting
    nearly all of the monster's abilities. That way they may even cast spells
    the monster was able to use or breathe elements like the monster did.
    Their primary stats are same as the warrior i.e. strength and constituion
    with dexterity coming in handy too.
    Intelligence is not of primary importance but it can help somewhat to
    increase the mana pool for making use of monster spells/breaths, and it
    also affects the success chance when attempting to use a monster power.
    Mimics learn forms by killing an amount of that monster type that is the
    same as the monster's level. Further, their 'Mimicry' skill must be at
    least 1/2 of the monster level or you won't gain knowledge from the kills.

    Example: To use the form of an Ancient Bronze Dragon (level 40) the
    mimic has to kill 40 of them and have a mimicry skill of at least 20.

    To find out the level and special abilities of a monster form, press '~'
    followed by '7' and look it up, then consult section (6.7) for how the
    monster details translate into mimic abilities.
    To find out how many monsters you already killed and how many you need
    in total to learn a form, press the '~' key followed by '2'.
    To polymorph into a form, press 'm' key, like casting a magic spell.
    (Forms that have DISBELIEVE ability are skipped when using the normal
    'Polymorph Self' spell. You have to use 'Polymorph Self Into..' if you
    want to use these forms.)

    A list of useful low-level humanoid forms for weapon-using mimics is given
    in (6.7c) because weapon-using mimics have a somewhat harder time to find
    usable forms early on than martial artists who might just utilize
    easy-to-get forms such as fruit bat, wild cat, crow or spiders right away
    for great effect.

    Mimics can get the highest amount of hit points of any class, even in the
    very long run ie at very high character levels far above 50, provided they
    acquire an appropriate high-level form (preferably level 80 or better).
    Low- and mid-level forms won't help high-level mimics that much to keep up
    their advantage in hit points, ie the extra hit points they gain from such
    forms will diminish as they continue to rise to very high character levels.

    Hint: Maybe there's a friendly mimicry-user around who can forge some
    'Rings of Polymorphing' for you from forms he or she no longer uses.
    As for all shape-shifters going with fruit bat body modification is not
    recommended, since it will restrict your equipment even if you polymorph.
    Pick one of the four weapon masteries (Sword/Blunt/Axe/Polearm), or Martial
    Arts if you don't want to use weapons, and always keep it maximized.

- Archer
    Archers aren't good at fighting, but can deliever extremely high damage
    with their ranged weapons. They can die quickly too, however.
    Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
    around with any bow, crossbow or sling and their primary stat is dexterity.
    An Archer is very bad at melee, being only better than mage-like classes.
    Archers will receive an array of special techniques to their disposal from
    training the 'Archery' skill, such as setting up a precise sniping shot at
    a target asleep or how to craft ammunition from rubble or from the bones
    of their opponents (see (6.12)), accessible via 'm' key or macro wizard.

    The first thing you should do when you created your character is making
    a macro for firing your bow. Press % and then z to start the macro wizard,
    and then c to create a firing macro.
    Even though archers start out with just a long bow for ranged weapon, they
    also get one of each of the 3 base types of ammo in the game (magic arrow
    for bow, magic bolt for crossbow, magic shot for sling) so you can buy any
    ranged weapon of your choice in the town stores and will have the matching
    type of ammo to go with it right from the start - press 'w' key to load it
    into your quiver.

    Hint: Enchanting your ranged weapon to-damage is especially effective,
    because the enchantment will be multiplied by the weapons multiplier, so
    buy enchant to-dam scrolls from the alchemy store as soon as you can afford
    them.
    Also make sure to have an ample supply of 'Scrolls of Phase Door'.
    Pick one of the three ranged masteries (Bow/Crossbow/Sling) and always
    keep it maximized.
    Note you can determine the order in which ammunition is listed in your
    backpack by simply dropping it and picking it up again in your preferred
    order.

- Paladin
    Paladins are a combination of warrior and priest. Holy knights that
    fight evil with a variety of melee weapons and divine support.
    Their primary stats are thus strength for fighting and wisdom for making
    use of divine prayers, with constitution and dexterity helping as usual.
    Paladins are nearly as strong as pure warriors and also highly proficient
    with shields which they use to deflect incoming attacks - although there
    is certainly no rule stating that they may not instead choose to use huge
    two-handed weapons for bestowing divine retribution upon their foes.
    Paladins however are not very good at missile weapons. They are poor at
    stealth, perception, and searching. They are better than warriors with
    magical devices and have an outstanding saving throw due to divine
    protection. On the downside they lack the proficiency of warriors when it
    comes to handling ranged weapons and they do not benefit as much from
    equipment that increases their mana pool as priests do.
    While they may train in all sorts of holy schools, they are slightly less
    adept at 'Holy Curing'.

    Hint: Note that the spell Holy Light can be used to deal decent damage
    after it's been brought up a few levels. Orcs are said to fear it a lot.
    Also make sure to create a macro for your fighting techniques 'Sprint' and
    'Taunt' when you learn them, they are great for catching annoying monsters
    that try to keep their distance to you. (See (6.12) for details.)
    Pick one of the four weapon masteries (Sword/Blunt/Axe/Polearm), and always
    keep it maximized. Unlike priests, paladins cannot train Martial Arts.

- Death Knight
    Death Knights are unfortunate souls who were paladins in life. Unable to
    die in peace they rose again as bloodthirsty, undead warriors.
    They have the same abilities as paladins in all regards but they are not
    able to utilize any kind of prayers and are susceptible to holy effects,
    instead they command unholy blood and shadow magic.
    Death knights resist fear intrinsically.

- Hell Knight
    This ultimately corrupted paladin can only be brought into existance when
    an astral spirit forsakes enlightenment and turns demonic instead.
    Imbued by the powers of chaos and hellflame, these warriors represent
    absolute treason without remorse.
    They have the same abilities as paladins in all regards but they are not
    able to utilize any kind of prayers and are susceptible to holy effects,
    instead they command blood magic and heretic magic of flame and chaos.

- Ranger
    Second only to adventurers regarding versatility rangers excel at a lot of
    skills: They are able to fight well in close combat and may even dual-wield
    two one-handed weapons at once which requires light armour to be efficient.
    This goes well with magic or archery which also would suffer from heavy
    armour.
    Devoted to nature in a similar way as druids rangers will avoid corrupted
    magic such as necromancy. They are however very adept at most other types
    of magic and also skilled trappers. Last but not least rangers display
    great performance with ranged weapons, able to train 'Archery' skill up to
    10.000, which apart from increasing their damage dealt also unlocks various
    special techniques to employ as they see fit.
    Rangers have good stealth, perception, searching, saving throws, and are
    good with magical devices. Rangers can find several different ways out of
    any situation. They use intelligence for spellcasting same as mages, they
    need strength if they rely on fighting in close combat, and they should
    have good dexterity if they aim at training ranged weapons.
    At level 8 rangers learn to find paths passing thick woods, and at 15 they
    have become very able swimmers as well.

    If you're planning to make use of ranged weapons, the first thing you
    should do when you created your character is making a macro for firing your
    bow. Press % and then z to start the macro wizard, and then c to create a
    firing macro. Buy arrows (to use with a bow) in store 1 or store 3 in town
    and put them in your quiver (w key). Crossbows require bolts, slings shots.

    Hint: Make sure to create a macro for your fighting techniques 'Sprint' and
    'Taunt' when you learn them, which you do pretty early on. They are great
    for catching annoying monsters that try to keep their distance to you.
    (See (6.12) for details about fighting techniques.)
    Since rangers can dual-wield and you start with light armour which is
    required for dual-wielding you might want to buy a secondary weapon right
    away, for example a cheap dagger, or even dispose of your starter weapon
    completely and go with two cheap, light weapons instead. (See (6.2) for
    details on dual-wielding.) This will increase your BpR by 1 or even 2!
    Note you can determine the order in which ammunition is listed in your
    backpack by simply dropping it and picking it up again in your preferred
    order.

- Adventurer
    Adventurers are hardy and versatile, they have no preferred way of fighting
    or magic, and can adapt to any situation at hand.
    They have no big big strengths nor weaknesses.
    Adventurers can train nearly all skills, but do not excel at any specific
    one. The size of their mana pool depends on both their intelligence and
    their wisdom in equal parts.
    Adventurers are often hybrids that combine various features of different
    and more distinct classes in one character, creating unusual mixtures of
    abilities.

    Hint: Adventurers are difficult to play for beginners because to fully
    utilize them you need to know exactly what you are trying to achieve and
    how you want to distribute their skill points to make them effective.

- Druid
    Druids are able to call upon the mystical powers of nature. Their wisdom
    is of primary importance to determine their mana and success chances when
    casting spells. Apart from the druidic schools, the other magic schools
    available to druids use intelligence for determining spell success chance.
    Druids fight using Martial Arts, which is the only melee skill they are
    able to train, as well as a variety of magic spells. Martial Arts means
    weaponless combats, not even ranged weapons, and only light armour, if any
    at all. (Martial artists actually get bonus armour class for each slot of
    armour that has no item equipped in it.)
    Druids can shapechange into several forms (mostly animals) without having
    to fight or kill them in order to learn those forms. Instead they learn
    one or more new forms automatically every five character levels.
    Even while transformed, druids can still equip all items they could equip
    in untransformed form, even if the monster form usually cannot use them.
    Because of this, going with a 'fruit bat' body modification in character
    creation would be especially ineffective for druids, because the fruit bat
    item restrictions would carry over to the druid forms, making otherwise
    usable slots unavailable.
    Despising the use of weapons they aren't as superb at close combat as
    warriors, but their Martial Arts training will make up for that and allow
    them quite a respectable performance.
    Druids learn how to quickly pass through thick forest at level 10 --
    note though that they can already do this at level 5 by simply polymorphing
    into an animal ('m' key), since all animals can pass forest easily.
    To review which forms you can transform into, use the /ex command.
    To see an overview of the forms and their abilities, see (6.7b).

    Hint: Druids have a powerful ranged area attack spell they can use very
    early on, Toxic Moisture. Look for it in the book store right away.
    Also make sure to create a macro for your fighting technique 'Sprint' when
    you learn it, which you do pretty early on. It is great for catching
    annoying monsters that try to keep their distance to you. (See (6.12).)
    As martial artists, druids do not require any armour early on in the game,
    it could even lower their AC instead of improving it.
    Always keep your Martial Arts skill maximized.

- Shaman
    Shamans are able to call upon both spiritual and magical powers, whatever
    they deem most appropriate. Their mind is also trained in a very versatile
    manner, allowing them to collect energy from intelligence or wisdom,
    whatever currently is easiest for them!
    Shamans are able to shapeshift same as mimics (see mimics above for details
    about how to learn forms) but they are limited to animals, trolls, giants,
    dragons and dragonriders, angels, hybrid creatures, golems, spirits,
    elementals and ghosts.
    However, they may use the latter three types while still wearing their full
    equipment and they are always able to move straight even if the creature in
    whose shape they appear usually moves erratically - these two are feats
    that mimics cannot achieve.
    Shamans learn elemental ('E') and semi-elemental ('X') forms especially
    quickly (one kill counts as three).
    Note that shamans cannot use non-living or undead forms except for ghosts,
    spirits, elementals and golems.
    While they are excellent at magic they have weaker combat abilities than
    rangers or paladins but still don't need to hide from a melee if trained
    properly.
    Their spiritual abilities allow them to easily train various aspects of
    necromancy as they see fit. Accordingly at level 20 shamans learn to
    perceive the invisible.

    Hint: Maybe there's a friendly mimicry-user around who can forge some
    'Rings of Polymorphing' for you from forms he or she no longer uses.
    In the beginning shamans have few hit points and skill point distribution
    isn't easy either, that's why this class is not recommended for beginners.
    As for all shape-shifters going with fruit bat body modification is not
    recommended, since it will restrict your equipment even if you polymorph.
    Note that all 'O' Ogre type monsters count as 'giants' too, so their forms
    are usable in shaman mimicry.

- Runemaster
    Runemasters use arcane symbols or 'runes' to summon pure elemental magic.
    They use their intelligence and dexterity to both manipulate and protect
    themselves from the fickle and dangerous forces of their art. Runemasters
    are not the most dedicated or systematic of adventurers, and often rely on
    trickery and sleight-of-hand. Because of this, and their tendency towards
    thievery, they are often mistaken for rogues. This roguish nature allows
    them to train in rogue-specific weapon proficiencies and skills, although
    their lack of dedication leaves 'Weaponmastery' as an unattainable goal.
    Runemasters are unable to to train in the martial arts, but are adept with
    boomerangs. High level users of runecraft may eventually enhance their
    armor and weapon with runic 'sigils', applying some resistance or boni
    according to the involved element. Elemental resistances are of particular
    importance to runemasters, who suffer a backlash of the according element
    instead of outright spell failure.

    For more information about runecraft, see '(6.8b) Runes & Runemastery'.
    Note that physical runes are not required to cast most runespells.
    However, having the physical runes are required for Sign, Sigil, and
    Enhanced spells. The last rune of a stack may be preserved with the !R
    inscription, to prevent unintentional loss of access to these spells.

    Hint: Runespells cause backlash of the active element on spell failure.
    For that reason you might use basic elemental spells in the beginning,
    against which you can easily acquire the required resistance, for example
    by buying a ring or amulet from the magic store. If you want to test rune
    combinations that pose a risk of going wrong badly, do so in the arena of
    the 'Arena Monster Challenge' event so you will get away unscathed.

- Mindcrafter
    Mindcrafters are great melee fighters who additionally train the use of
    telepathy to unleash spells formed by their psychic powers.
    Their intellect is superior compared to primitive warriors, making them
    calm and silent fighters who are hard to read and are dangerously sharp.
    They have a lot of possibilities to positively or negatively influence the
    minds of others. However, their repertoire is more limited when they are up
    against creatures of little or no intelligence.
    Their primary attribute is intelligence, which determines their spell
    fail rates as well as the majority of their mana pool. Also somewhat
    affecting their mana pool are charisma and wisdom, although they are
    not mandatory for becoming an able telepathy user.
    Aside from intelligence as primary spell-casting stat they will also want
    decent strength for engaging in close combat.
    Putting on heavy head gear (above 4.0 lb) will negatively impact their
    amount of psychic energy.
    Mindcrafters will learn to resist sanity-draining effects a bit at level
    10, and somewhat better even at level 20. They also have a good chance to
    resist the adverse effects of encountering an eldritch horror (see (6.3)
    under 'Saving Throw' for details on those), they also resist mind-blanking
    attemps and psionic attacks in general much better than other classes.
    A lot of their spells can actually be cast while blinded (or even
    confused), and their targetted spells often do not require a clean line of
    sight, since they manifest whereever their mind is focussed on
    (e.g. Psionic Blast).
    Their spells also cannot be reflected by monsters for that same reason.
    Some of the mindcrafters' spells that interact with party members will
    require them to prepare and open their mind for telepathic contact. This
    is done by the party members pressing the 'p' key. Pressing it again will
    close off their mind again, disabling further telepathic attempts.
    The effects of some necromancy skills are distracting to mindcrafters, so
    training them will require more effort.
    They are able to detect 'Telepath' ego monsters via ESP which usually are
    able to conceal their presence telepathically versus all other classes.
    Similarly at level 30 they become able to pinpoint opponents that attempt
    to make use of cloaking or shadowing techniques (monsters only).
    Mindcrafters learn to judge their own sanity much more accurately as they
    gain levels, getting a more detailed sanity display at level 10, 20 and 40
    (same as other characters get when they actually train 'Health' skill to
    10, 20 or 40).

    Hint: Mindcrafters have a powerful ranged attack spell they can use very
    early on, Psionic Blast. Look for it in the book store right away.
    Also get the spell 'Autokinesis I' early on, which is a form of phase door.
    Pick one of the four weapon masteries (Sword/Blunt/Axe/Polearm), or Martial
    Arts if you don't want to use weapons, and always keep it maximized.


As you gain levels, you will get new profession titles. These are displayed
between your class name and your character level in the main window. If you die
and become a ghost, the title will change to 'Ghost' until you get revived.
Titles change every 5 levels, the final title is received on level 50.
From level 60 and upwards there are special titles available every 10 levels.


Here is a table showing boni/mali of the different races:
'Blows/Round' is the maximum number of melee attacks per round a character can
have basing on strength and dexterity and on the weapon's weight.
To that maximum of blows per round further boni are added, like extra blows
from a specific weapon-type mastery or from rings of extra attacks or magical
influence from priest prayer 'Zeal'.
Note that these blows/round limits don't count for Martial Arts users (as long
as they fight barehanded). See (5.3a) for a table of MA attacks.
"Parrying" is done with weapons, while "blocking" is done with a shield;
See (6.11) for details about parry and block.

For melee characters, it's especially vital to know how many blows per round
they will get right after character creation, to avoid them being unnecessarily
weak during low-mid levels.
So a melee-oriented character should make sure to start with sufficient
STRength and DEXterity to be able to get at least 2 blows/round with the
lightest possible weapons. (Getting more bpr with heavy weapons is a luxury
that will have to be put aside until later in the game.)

Note that a (heavier) startup weapon at 2 bpr might beat a very light weapon at
3 bpr for a few levels at the beginning, maybe up to 4 or so. So you can wait
for a little a bit until spending $ on it.


(6.5a) Start-up Blows/Round Table
---------------------------------
Here is a table, showing you some bpr numbers you can expect your newly
created character to have, depending on certain combinations of class, STR,
DEX, given for both, lightest possible weapon and startup weapon:
(Don't forget that some classes can dual-wield, adding an extra +1 bpr on top!)

Note: 'Light' weapon may refer to as low as 3.0 lb (varies depending on STR
      and DEX - any weapon that weighs at most 3.0 lb will definitely work).

Class           STR     DEX     Light weapon    Startup weapon

Druid           -

Shaman          similar to priest

Runemaster      similar to rogue

Mindcrafter     similar to ranger

So if you're playing a melee-oriented characer, make sure you start with at
least 2 bpr (in some cases you might have to buy very light weapon and discard
your starter weapon to achieve this)!

If you think it's strange that 'Mimic fights similar to Priest' keep in mind
that this is not about actual melee potential, but rather about some sort of
'blows/round improvement curve' displayed by a class. If a class is busy
studying other things in parallel (magic), its learning curve gets less steep.
This, however, doesn't determine its final performance, which is actually
given by the 'Max. base blows/round' shown further above, and other parameters.



(6.6) Sanity (or insanity)
--------------------------
Your sanity can have the following values:
Sound, Sane, Weird, Insane, Mad, Vegetable.

If you spend 10 points on your 'Health' skill, the sanity display will turn
into a bar, displaying exacter values. At 20 points you'll get the percentage
displayed. At 40 the value will be shown.

At the beginning, your sanity is always 'Sound'. That means you are completely
sane. Monsters or traps can reduce your sanity. If your sanity drops below 0,
your mind will be qualified as an unthinking vegetable, this means your
character is permanently dead, so be extremely cautious! Fortunately there are
potions available that cure your sanity, although they are not very common and
cannot be bought in shops. Wisdom helps against insanity by inceasing your
'sanity capacity'. As you gain levels, your sanity capacity will also increase.
However, this means IF your sanity drops to dangerous regions, you will need
more potions to cure it.

If your sanity is lowered, there's an increasing chance that flashbacks will
storm your head, leaving you with mad visions for a while..
("A flashback storms your head!")

When your sanity suffers from an attack, you'll see a light red message in the
message window telling you so, instead of the usual white or yellow combat
messages, to make it easily visible.

Certain classes such as priests or mindcrafters may depending on their skills
be able to cure insanity.



(6.7) Mimicry details
---------------------
If a mimic polymorphs into a certain monster form, abilities and stats will be
averaged between the normal ('@') body and the form. In most cases if the form
is performing worse than @-form in a certain field, the @-form will dominate
and the ability will be only slightly worse than normal, if even at all.
The averaging is done because the mimic with all his equipment polymorphs into
the target form. It's not like the polymorphing is done first and afterwards
armour, weapon or jewelry is equipped.
So wearing a ring of protection for example won't plainly add to the mimic's
AC but just contribute to the @-form AC which is then averaged in the process
of determining the final form's AC.
How exactly stats are calculated is written below for each case.

If a mimic wields a weapon while using a form which usually cannot use weapons
the number of blows per round will be set to 1 (regardless of extra attacks).
(This only really applies to druids, shamans or perma-cursed weapons (5.14)).

Apart from blows-per-round, all the other resistances and abilities of a
perma-cursed item will be applied normally though, so you could wear the
Massive Iron Crown of Morgoth to get all the resistances and ESP with a form
that usually cannot wear any head gear.

To find out the special abilities of a monster form, press  ~ 7  in game or
consult a spoiler file. (See (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)
It's abilities will transform to the mimic's body as follows.


Form aspects as specified in  ~ 7  monster lore:
(Make sure to keep your r_info.txt spoiler file up to date, as the lore
displayed via ~7 is derived from it.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
W: depth : rarity : corpse weight : experience for kill
  depth:
    The depth is also the basic level of these monsters. It tells you how
    many of them you need to kill to learn mimicking their form.
    The level has additional use for calculating the mimic's final hit points
    regarding very high character levels (see 'hit points' below).
  corpse weight:
    The weight of the form has impact on its stealth. A huge form that weighs
    a lot will give a stealth penalty, while small and light forms may give a
    bonus.

I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
  speed:
    110 means normal speed. If the monster is faster, the mimic will
    receive a speed bonus of 30% of the monster's speed above 110.
    If the monster is slower, the mimic will receive a speed malus of
    20% of the monster's speed malus below 110.
    So a monster moving at 130 speed will give the mimic +6 speed.
  hit points:
    The monster's hit dice xdy are multiplied and then somewhat capped against
    ~2500, so HP gain might decrease in higher regions. (Cap details: The
    monster HP is calculated by the following formula before further
    calculations are made: monster HP = 50000 / ((50000 / hdice*hsides) + 20).)
    Now, if the mimic's HP are less then the result, the mimic's HP will
    become approx. 2/5 of that capped monster HP + 3/5 of the player's original
    HP. If the mimic's HP in player form (code 0) are higher than the monster
    HP then the monster HP will not have any adverse effect, instead the normal
    HP will stay.
    A specialty: Players in very high character levels can see their hit points
    'overtake' the monster form hit points, if the monster form level isn't
    very high in comparison. Example: While a green dragonrider will provide a
    great HP boost, if the player himself has reached say level 70 and has lots
    of HP even in normal form, the green DR hit points won't add much anymore.
    If however the monster has high hit points and also a very high level, the
    monster HP will 'stay ahead' of the player hit points ie keep adding a
    steady bonus that will put him well ahead of his player-form hit points.
    So players of very high character level who want to retain a large bonus of
    hit points will want to look for forms of monsters which are also of
    relatively high level.
  armour class:
    Mimicking a monster is already a very difficult task. By changing
    shape, the usual armour class of the monster will magically influence
    the armour class of the player.
    Depending on the body parts of the monster, its AC has different
    influence on the player. The following formula helps:
    body_influence = 0.
    if the monster has a head, body_influence is increased by 1.
    if the monster has a torso, body_influence is increased by 3.
    if the monster has arms, body_influence is increased by 2.
    if the monster has legs, body_influence is increased by 1.
    calc_ac = monster_AC * 14 / (7 + body_influence)
    Now if calc_ac is smaller than the player's AC, the final AC will be
    (3/4 player_base_AC) + (3/4 player_magical_to_AC) + (1/4 calc_ac).
    Otherwise, the final AC will be
    (1/2 player_base_AC) + (1/2 player_magical_to_AC) + (1/2 calc_ac).
  vision:
    Searching ability of the player =
    (player_searching / 2) + (monster_vision / 10)
    Perception of the player =
    (player_perception / 2) + (monster_vision / 10)

E: hands : torso : arms : finger : head : leg
    These values indicate how many pieces of equipment the player can
    wear while using this form. For example snakes can only wear a helmet
    (E:0:0:0:0:1:0).
    NOTE: Mimics can never wear MORE items than in their normal form. So
    even a form with 8 legs would allow only 1 pair of boots to be equipped!
    In the monster lore (~7) some monsters may show 'tentacles'. These count
    for three limb-types together: Hands regarding wielding a weapon, fingers
    (can wear rings) and arms (can wield shields). Tentacles are not fit for
    wearing gloves though.

B: attack method : attack effect : damage
  attack effect:
    POISON,DISEASE,FIRE,COLD,ELEC,ACID:
      If the monster poisons or infects with disease, this will result in
      a poison brand. Similar it's for fire/cold/lightning/acid attacks.
    BLIND won't work on monsters that have NO_SLEEP, otherwise the target
      will be confused.
    HALLUCINATION and CONFUSE won't work on monsters that have NO_CONF,
      otherwise the target will be confused.
    TERRIFY won't work on monsters that have NO_FEAR, otherwise it'll
      scare the target.
    PARALYZE won't work on monsters that have NO_STUN, otherwise it'll
      stun the target.
    EXP_xx means the monster drains life on attacking. The player will
      receive HOLD_LIFE (resist life-draining attacks) from this form.
    SHATTER will result in a bonus to player's STRength attribute.
    LOSE_xxx will give the according sustenance.

    Monster effects (like poisoning or paralyzing) are applied to
    the player's attacks with a probability that corresponds to their
    rarity over the up to 4 monster attacks per round.
    Example for 'Ghoul' form:
    If the monster has 3 blows per round and one of them is poisoning,
    the other two are paralyzing, the mimic will have 1/3 chance to do
    a poison branded attack and 2/3 chance to do a stunning attack.

    These effects won't be applied if one of the following conditions
    is met:
    a) The player is doing a ranged attack.
       (Effects only work with melee attacks!)
    b) The player uses a weapon but the monster doesn't have an
       equipment slot for melee weapons, because it has no arms or is
       immaterial.

    Melee to-damage bonus also depends on the monster form:
    The monster damage dice for each attack are multiplied and the products
    are all added up, the result is divided by 4.
    The result is now capped against 200, the closer this graph comes towards
    200 the flatter the curve will become. Let's call the resulting monster
    damage value 'monDam':
    This value is now compared against the player's melee to-damage bonus.
    If (monDam > meleetoDam) then newToDam = 1/2 meleetoDam + 1/2 monDam.
    If (monDam < meleetoDam) then newToDam = meleetoDam.
    So, very similar to how HP are averaged, the monster damage has no
    influence if it's lower than the player's melee to-damage bonus, but it
    may provide a great boost if the monster is more powerful than the player.

F: flag list
    The flags are translated to mimic abilities as follows:
    RES_xxx     Gives the mimic the specific resistance.
    IM_xxx      Gives the mimic the specific immunity! If a form offers
                more than 1 immunity, the immunities will be checked against
                the preferences you set, if none match or if you set it to none
                then one will be picked randomly. The remaining ones will turn
                into resistances. Potions of self-knowledge are helpful here to
                find out which one you got, or you could just suffer damage of
                the according type on purpose to test it out.
                You can set the desired immunity in 'm' menu ->
                'Use innate power' -> 'Set preferred immunity'. It will be
                picked if the form you polymorph into can provide it.
                If you are already using a form that can provide the immunity
                that you switch to, that immunity will become the active one
                immediately without the need for re-polymorphing.
                (Note: IM_TELE actually always gives RES_TELE.)
    PASS_WALL   Will allow the mimic to pass walls like a ghost.
                These immaterial forms also drain the hit points of their
                user.
    KILL_WALL   The mimic will dig *easily* through walls.
    REGENERATE  Faster hit point regeneration (same as item ability, doesn't
                stack with regeneration obtained from item flag).
    REFLECTING  Gives 'reflect' ability to the player, see (5.8) for details.
                (Side note about monster reflection in general:
                The 'REFLECTING' flag on monsters gives them a flat 50% chance
                to reflect physical or magical projectiles.)
    CAN_SWIM    The player can pass water fields without problems.
    CAN_FLY     The player can levitate.
    STUPID      -2 intelligence.
    SMART       +2 intelligence.
    NO_CONF     Confusion resistance.
    NO_FEAR     Fear resistance.
    NO_SLEEP    Free action.
    NO_STUN     Sound resistance.
    NO_CUT      The player can't be cut and won't bleed continously from
                wounds.
    DISBELIEVE  Will increase the player's anti-magic field by
                ((monsterlevel / 2) + 10) percent. The range of the anti-magic
                field is increased by ((monsterlevel / 50) + 2) fields.
    ARROW_1, ARROW_2, ARROW_3
                The player will receive an extra shot per round with slings or
                bows since the monster seems to be good at shooting.
                If the monster shoots 1_IN_3 or better (better means faster,
                ie higher frequency, that is 1_IN_2 or 1_IN_1), the player will
                receive an additional extra shot (with crossbows too).
    HURT_ROCK   Means that this creature has a rock-like skin and body.
                Takes damage from Stone-To-Mud and takes more damage from
                'disintegration' attacks, but at the same time resists shards!
    WILD_WOOD   The player (like the monster) can pass trees.
    WILD_MOUNTAIN or WILD_VOLCANO
                The player (like the monster) can climb mountains.
    WILD_TOO without any other WILD_xxx flags:
                Combines all WILD_xxx effects (such as WILD_WOOD and
                WILD_MOUNTAIN)!
    INVISIBLE   The player becomes invisible (see (5.16) for details).
    AURA_FIRE or AURA_ELEC
                The player receives an aura.
    SUSCEP_FIRE/SUSCEP_COLD/SUSCEP_ELEC/SUSCEP_ACID/SUSCEP_POIS
                The player is susceptible against these attacks. Dangerous!
    WIERD_MIND/RES_PSI
                Insanity attacks are reduced a little bit. (Overrides S-flags)
                Also helps somewhat against the effects of encountering an
                eldritch horror (see (6.3) under 'Saving Throw' for details on
                those).
    EMPTY_MIND/IM_PSI
                Insanity attacks are reduced somewhat. (Overrides S-flags)
                Also helps somewhat against the effects of encountering an
                eldritch horror (see (6.3) under 'Saving Throw' for details on
                those).
    AQUATIC     Gives superb water resistance.
    NEVER_MOVE  Using this form, the player won't be able to move (except for
                teleportation/phasing/recalling).
    RAND_25     The player has +10% chance of moving randomly.
    RAND_50     The player has +20% chance of moving randomly.
    OPEN_DOOR   This form can open doors.
                Note that forms can open doors even if they don't have this
                flag, provided they have fingers and are able to wield weapons
                (a good example are Minotaur/Maulotaur forms of druids).
    BASH_DOOR   This form can bash doors
                (useful to forms that cannot open doors, see OPEN_DOOR flag).
    HURT_LITE   This form will take 2x damage from light attacks.
    HAS_LITE    If this monster either doesn't have a torso or can actually
                breathe light, it will give you +1 light radius.

    For all racial flags such as ANIMAL, SPIDER, EVIL, DEMON etc please see the
    list of racial abilities further below.

S: spell list
    These spells can be cast by the monster. Most of them are available to
    the mimic too, called 'mimic powers', some of them may have slightly
    different effects when used by the mimic. For a list of all available
    mimic powers see (6.8a).
    The chance to successfully use such a monster power is affected by the
    mimic's intelligence (INT).
    Depending on how frequently the monster is able to cast spells, the player
    gets boni on mana and on intelligence or wisdom stat!
    This only applies if the spells are in fact magic spells, not if the
    monster cannot do anything except firing missiles, shrieking or shooting
    arrows (etc).
    If the creature is able to cast 1_IN_3, the player receives +1 stat and
    +20% Mana bonus (of base mana, same way +MANA items work).
    If the creature is able to cast 1_IN_2, the player receives +3 stat and
    +35% Mana bonus (of base mana, same way +MANA items work).
    If the creature is able to cast 1_IN_1, the player receives +4 stat and
    +50% Mana bonus (of base mana, same way +MANA items work).

    About specific spells:
    BR_xxx      (breathing) will give the according resistance to the player
                (if that specific attack CAN be resisted at all).
    BR_PLASMA   gives fire immunity and resistance to electricity and sound.
    BR_GRAVITY  gives feather falling.
    BR_INERTIA  gives free action.
    MIND_BLAST  Insanity attacks are reduced a little bit.
    BRAIN_SMASH Insanity attacks are reduced somewhat.
    The mana costs of mimic powers are fixed, the success chance is relatively
    fixed too although it benefits somewhat from 'Magic' skill.

Especially interesting spells of mimics are 'Blink' (Phase Door) and
'Teleport'. These usually cost very little mana and can be very helpful,
so you might want to create macros for them.


Further, certain races get additional fixed abilities
(even if they are not explicitely mentioned in ~7):

Keep in mind that by changing forms you can potentially lose abilities that
you had in player form, because they were bound to your normal form.
Example: An ent mimic won't drown in water, but if it polymorphs into an orc,
it loses the intrinsic ability to pass water since orcs aren't made of wood.


Attributes and miscellaneous abilities can also be affected by certain aspects
of the monster form you use:
----------------------------
(Note that all bonus aspects stack, so a troll might get much more than just +1
to strength, because he's also quite heavy and therefore gets another bonus.)
STR     Melee damage: -1..+4 (-1 won't apply if creature is very heavy though)
        Earthquaking melee hits: +1 each
        Body weight: +1..+3
        Bears: +1
        Trolls: +1
        Giants: +1
        Dragons (mature and higher): +1
INT     Cast speed (1_IN_1 to 1_IN_3): +1..+5
        (will also give up to +50% base mana)
        STUPID creatures: -2
        SMART creatures: +2
DEX     Halfling forms when no boots are worn: +2
        Rogues: +1..+2
        Monks/Master warriors: +1
        Ninjas/Mystics: +2
        Cats: +2
CHR     Dragonriders: +1
        Small, non-nasty animals: +1
        Spiders, orcs: -1
        Trolls, giants: -2
        Nonliving/evil creatures: -1
        Undead/demons: -2
        GOOD creatures: +2

Stealth         Body weight: -4..+3
Infra-Vision    Undead in general: +1
                Ghosts specifically: +3


Intrinsic abilities that aren't kept when changing forms:
---------------------------------------------------------
Characters keep certain racial abilities even if they change form, while some
other abilities might not persist through polymorphing. The following abilities
will NOT remain active when changing shape, ie are not "polymorph-proof":

Hobbit:
    +DEX bonus from not wearing shoes.
Dwarf:
    Climbing.
Yeek:
    Pass trees.
Ent:
    Speed malus (will be reduced), swimming, pass trees.
Draconian:
    Feather falling, levitation.
    Intrinsic breath weapon - you can only use it if you're actually in dragon
    form (including dragonriders) or in any reptilian form (including Hydras).

Abilities acquired from traits (such as 'enlightened' or 'corrupted' trait for
Maiar) are also considered intrinsic abilities and therefore polymorph-proof if
they aren't on the list above.


(6.7a) Polymorph rings ('Ring of Polymorphing of <form>'):
----------------------------------------------------------
There are two types of polymorph rings, those which already provide a monster
form and those which can still be forged by a mimic. Latter ones are named
'Rings of Polymorphing of Player', while the first ones are named after the
monster form.

A player can use a ring that carries a monster form, by wearing it and
activating it. The user needs a mimicry skill of at least 1/2 the level of
the monster in order to activate the ring and must be eligible to use that form
in general (shamans cannot use certain forms). The ring will disintegrate and
the player will polymorph into the according form for the number of turns the
ring specified. The turns are depending on floor speed, which means they will
run out faster on shallow levels and slower on deeper levels relative to
real time, but in fact always at same speed in character time! (See (4.14) for
more information about the in-game time system.)
As a rule of thumb, a dungeon turn lasts about 1 second on average (noticably
less in town or very shallow levels).
However, the remaining polymorph duration will stop decreasing while you are
in a town and surrounding area, so you don't have to hurry while shopping.
If a character activates a poly ring and then manually polymorphs into another
form, the remaining form duration is saved so he can turn back into the ring's
form later. Only one ring form can be saved at a time. Note that there is an
activation tax of 10 turns everytime the player polymorphs into the stored
form (except for the initial polymorphing from activating the ring).

NOTE: UN_POWER attacks can drain the remaining time a temporary form lasts!

At around 100 turns (or less if there isn't more time left) before a form runs
out the player will receive a warning message about this, and his appearance
will start to flicker between the temporary form and his normal form, to
indicate visually that it won't last very much longer.

Players can also create monster rings out of 'polymorph player' rings, by
mimicking the according form, then wearing the ring and activating it.
The ring will turn into a ring of polymorphing of the current monster form.
However, to create such a ring it is required that the player has already
learnt that form. All of his knowledge will be absorbed into the ring, so
the player will completely forget the form and have to re-learn it if he
wants to use it again!

The level of the ring will change depending on the form. Here are some levels:
form level              ring level
----------------------------------
      0 (townspeople)        5
      1                      5
     15                     14
     30                     22
     60                     36
     80                     43
    100 (theoretical)       50

Polymorph rings contain a certain amount of energy that cannot be changed,
which determined for how long the player will keep the form until he polymorphs
back to normal.
If a player forges a ring, his 'Magic Device' skill helps to obtain a high
amount of energy in the ring.


(6.7b) Druid form details
-------------------------
The according polymorph code is given in parentheses below the creature name.
Note: Some druid forms can open doors, others may try to bash doors.
      Also, all animal forms are able to travel through woods.
You can use the /ex command in game to see which forms you can use, and what
polymorph code they have.

Note: If a monster can fly that means it will grant the player the 'levitation'
      ability.

    Aquatic forms also resist all water-based attacks *greatly*.


(6.7c) Useful low-level humanoid forms for weapon-using mimics
--------------------------------------------------------------
Mimics who use weapons have less choices for forms than martial artists who do
not need to rely on humanoid forms and can just utilize easy-to-get forms such
as fruit bat, wild cat, spiders, birds or hounds right away to great effect.

To use weapons however, the form must be humanoid or very close to it, which
rules out animal forms. To make form-hunting a bit easier in the beginning here
is a list of useful low-level forms that are humanoid and allow the player to
wear/wield full equipment:

 -- Note: Forms usable by shamans are marked with an asterisk '*'. --

Forms you can already get in Bree town:
---------------------------------------
Village idiot    1  Its pretty weak and has slightly erratic movement which can
                    be a bit annoying but it gives a speed bonus which can be
                    somewhat useful when fighting.
Mean-looking mercenary
Battle-scarred veteran
                 1  They can improve your initial HP (hit points) and AC
                    (armour class) fairly well.
                    They both have slightly erratic movement though.

Further forms:
--------------
Note: Nearly all of these actually occur in packs (although some of them might
      also sometimes appear on their own) making them even easier to attain.

Small kobold     1  Actually very weak, but it has poison resistance. This way
(or normal kobold)  this form may help you to kill Rotting corpses (see below)
                    which have poisonous melee attacks. ;)
                    Not really useful other than that.
Novice mage      2  Sort of weak but has 'Blink' spell (aka Phase Door) and
                    more.
                    It occurs solo at depth 2, but in packs at depth 6!
Novice priest    2  Sort of weak but can cast fear/curse and self-heal spells.
                    It occurs solo at depth 2, but in packs at depth 6!
*Poltergeist     3  Useful only for shamans because it has no limbs!
                    This form can pass solid walls and makes you invisible!
                    Also gives fear/confusion/cold/sound/insanity/time
                    resistance, free action, poison immunity, and you won't
                    bleed from cuts.
                    However, since Poltergeister are invisible, finding them
                    might prove troublesome. An easier to spot ghost form is
                    the 'Phantom warrior' (see further below).
Novice ranger    4  Can pass trees easily. Gives an extra shot with slings or
                    bows. This can be pretty powerful early on if the
                    character has a decent 'bows/throws' ability or has a bow
                    that is well enchanted to-hit.
                    It occurs solo at depth 4, but in packs at depth 8!
N. mindcrafter   4  Free action, resists confusion and slightly insanity too.
                    Can cast blind/slow/confuse/fear spells.
                    It occurs solo at depth 4, but in packs at depth 8!
Large kobold     5  As all kobolds it has poison resistance. It also has a lot
                    of hit points and very good AC for its level.
Rotting corpse   8  Free action, resists confusion/fear/cold, poison immunity,
                    brands melee attacks with poison, decent AC.
*Phantom warrior 8  Useful only for shamans because it has no limbs!
                    This form can pass solid walls!
                    Also gives fear/sound/insanity resistance, free action,
                    poison immunity, and you won't bleed from cuts.
Tengu           10  High HP, good AC, can blink/teleport and more, resists fear
                    and fire, can levitate. A secret tip for form hunters!
                    (Does not occur in packs.)
*Master yeek    12  Although everyone knows that Yeek = weak, this particular
                    kind of Yeek can cast some interesting magic spells.
                    And as a plus it's actually immune to acid.
*Air spirit     12  Useful only for shamans because it has no limbs!
                    Since this is an 'E' form, shamans learn it very quickly.
                    An insanely powerful early shaman form, since it gives a
                    big speed bonus, levitation and invisibility!
                    It also gives free action and resists fear, confusion,
                    light, dark, bleeding (cannot be cut), insanity,
                    electricity and poison and immunity to either electricity
                    or poison.
Illusionist and Druid
                13  These two have an array of spells at their disposal, one of
                    them being 'Haste' which speeds themselves up temporarily,
                    which can be a very powerful asset.
                    These two monsters appear somewhat rarely though.
                    (Later on, 'Mage' is a mid-level form that also provides
                    haste spell and is actually more common to find.)
                    (These two do not occur in packs.)
*Ogre           13  This form can cross thick woods and mountain terrain.
                    Note that Ogres also count as giants which means that
                    shamans can use this form too.
                    (This monster occurs somewhat more rarely than the others.)
Black orc       13  Good HP, good melee damage, +1 extra shot w/ slings/bows.
Lizard man      16  High HP, can swim easily, resists water, immune to acid.
                    (This monster occurs somewhat more rarely than the others.)
*Ogrillon       16  Very high HP for its level, good melee damage.
                    Note that Ogrillons also count as giants which means that
                    shamans can use this form too.
                    (This monster occurs somewhat more rarely than the others.)
Uruk            16  Good HP, good melee damage, good AC, +1 extra shot w/
                    slings or bows, poison immunity.
*Umber hulk     16  Shamans can use full equipment in this form, others cannot.
                    Since this is an 'X' form, shamans learn it very quickly.
                    It's not really strong but it destroys walls just by moving
                    into them, allowing you to tunnel easily without any
                    digging tool.
                    Also it is immune to poison, paralysis and confusion, you
                    won't bleed if you get cut, and its melee attacks may have
                    a confusion effect (which makes fighting it in close combat
                    a bit dangerous).
                    (Does not occur in packs.)
*Forest troll   17  High HP, good AC, can pass trees, gives 'HP regeneration'
                    (same as item flag).
*Earth spirit   17  Useful only for shamans because it has no limbs!
                    Since this is an 'E' form, shamans learn it very quickly.
                    Similar to Air spirit (see further above) this form comes
                    with very useful abilities (and more hit points), even
                    though it is less speedy than Air spirits. Earth spirits
                    can pass solid walls and also fly, giving them ultimate
                    mobility. It gives free action and resists fear, confusion,
                    light, dark, bleeding (cannot be cut), shards, fire, cold,
                    electricity and poison, and gives immunity to one of
                    fire, cold, electricity and poison.
Elite uruk      20  Good HP, very high melee damage, good AC, +1 extra shot w/
                    slings or bows, poison immunity.
Dark-elven Lord 20  Good HP, resists darkness but is susceptible to light-based
                    attacks. Moves fast and even has a 'Haste' spell in his
                    array of spells that boosts his speed further.
                    This monster occurs somewhat rarely.
                    (Does not occur in packs.)

(The number is the monster level and therefore the amount of monsters you need
to kill to learn the form.)

Of course some of these forms might also be useful for martial arts users.
(Note that martial artists cannot make use of ranged weapons or weapons in
general though, without losing their excellent bare-handed melee skills.)

Commonly seen advanced forms: Bloodletter of Khorne, Storm Giant, Dragonriders.



(6.8) Magic spells and prayers
------------------------------
Istari (mages), rangers, rogues, priests, paladins, druids, shamans,
mindcrafters and even adventurers can cast magic spells, use telepathic powers
(which are the same as spells, technically) or speak prayers.
To do so, they need the according spell scrolls (which contain exactly one
specific spell) or books (such as Codices, Spell Books, Grimoires, Handbooks
or Tomes, that contain several different spells) in their inventory.

The failure rate when attempting to successfully cast a spell is usually shown
when browsing the according spell scroll/crystal, and is determined by your
intelligence or wisdom, and the spell's level. For details see (6.8d).

Some spells have an instant effect, other spells have a lasting effect over a
certain duration, most commonly storm-type or cloud-type spells which deal
damage over time. Such spells that have lasting effects on the map grids do not
stack! For example, casting Noxious Cloud and immediately afterwards Vapor will
cause the Noxious Cloud getting replaced by Vapor on all map grids where they
would overlap.

Spell scrolls and some books can be purchased in store '9' (the 'book store',
usually also sells 'Beginner Cantrips' and sometimes also Codices) or in
'7' (the 'black market' - very expensive but you often find tomes here!).
Book stores in higher-level towns on average also tend to sell higher-level
spells. You can also use the 'o' key in the book store to order specific
spells! Note that in the book store it is sufficient to just enter the spell
name when ordering, you don't need to type out the full item name of the
spell scroll/crystal.

Note that you must spend enough points into a particular magic school (or
into sorcery) for the spell turning from grey into green in your spell book,
in order to use that spell. A spell will turn green when its current level has
become at least 1.
A level 'x' spell will requires at least 'x' points in its school before you
can cast it and it turns green. You'll cast it at spell level 1 then. If you
spend more points into that school the spell will become more powerful as its
spell level increases.

Example:
Noxious Cloud is a level 3 spell of the Air school. That means if you spend at
least 3 points into Air school, the spell will become usable and be displayed
as "level 1" in your 'Spell Scroll of Noxious Cloud' you just bought from the
Book Store in Bree (symbol '9').
If you raise your Air school to 6 by spending 3 more points into it, the level
of your Noxious Cloud spell will increase by 3 and now be displayed as
"level 4" in your spell scroll. The spell now deals more damage and lasts
longer than it did on power level 1 when you just barely learned it.

Casting spells on other players:
Some spells have effect on fellow players too, this works regardless of whether
they are in the same party or not. In most cases the player needs to stand next
to the caster for it to work.
This area effect around the caster, in which a spell affects other players
standing next to him, is called spell "projection". The spells which project
onto other players are marked by an '(auto-project)' tag.
Some Mindcrafter spells require the target player to open his mind ('p' key) to
receive the spell effect.
Just for completeness: Rune magic that can affect other players does so
automatically too, same as school magic.

Shared school spells:
Some spells are shared between different schools, occuring possibly but not
necessarily in both of the schools. When a spell is shared between two schools
it means that training in one of those schools will increase the spell level
by only half that amount. So if you want to increase a shared spell by say 5
points, you either have to increase both of its schools by 5, or one of them
by 10.

Magic, holy and occult schools give certain permanent boni and abilities to
the player, when trained to a certain extent. The boni are listed below each
school.

                    Only Istari are able to really get the most out of it -
                    they get 1 mana point deducted for each absorbed point of
                    damage. Other classes will instead get 2 mana points

    Telekinesis I   Inscribe your book @P<Playername>, cast it, select an
                    item that you wish to teleport to the player's inventory.
                    The target player needs to concentrate by opening her/his
                    mind, see (0.2). It's dangerous to have the mind opened,
                    since everyone can send you any items, so better close it
                    again as soon as the desired telekinesis transaction is
                    done. Example inscription: @PGandalf
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 35.
                    Shared spell (see above): Mind, Conveyance.

                    Renders you instable, allowing to pass walls and to
                    float upwards/downwards. Floating up/down will skip floors
                    that have other players on them, except if at least one of
                    them is in your party (or if it's the world surface level).
                    If all floors in the (up or down) direction of your attempt
                    to probtravel are occupied by players you get this message:
        "There is a magical discharge in the air as probability travel fails!"

    Mass Warp       Locks monsters in stasis for a while.

                    because this spell internally works like genocide and not

- Mental Intrusion
 (Note that psi attacks don't have any effect on angels, nonliving creatures,
 or empty-minded creatures, and that undead, stupid creatures and common
 animals as well as weird-minded creatures may resist it. At the same time,
 smart creatures might be hit especially hard.
 Targets that might resist psi attacks, but which are already confused when
 they get hit, get their chance to resist nullified by the confusion.
 As a side effect, psi attacks themselves have a chance to cause confusion to
 the target, thereby increasing their effect when the target is hit by another
 psi attack afterwards.
 if a monster does not resist a psi attack, it may suffer from additional
 effects besides confusion, such as fear, stun or sleep.)

    Psionic Blast   Blasts the target's mind with psionic energy.
                    Possibly causing various additional effects.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 1.

    Psychic Suppression
                    Drains the target's psychic energy, impacting its ability
                    to cast spells temporarily, effectively silencing it for a
                    short period of time.
                    Chance to be successful depends on school skill vs monster
                    level. Also, monsters that can't cast any spells as well as
                    unique monsters of level 98 or above are unaffected.
                    Monsters that are unique or powerful have an increased
                    chance to resist.
                    The target cannot be silenced again for a short while,
                    until the effect runs out. Note that the target also
                    becomes immune to the effect for the same short amount of
                    time if the attempt was actually unsuccessful.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 10.

    Psi Storm       Psionic storm that damages and disturbs all minds within an
                    area for a while, causing the usual random Psi side effects
                    on all targets similar to Psionic Blast.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 18.

    Remote Vision   Tries to forcibly enter all sentient creatures' minds
                    (including invisible monsters, but never empty-minded ones)
                    on the level, in order to use their vision to make the
                    dungeon structure known to yourself.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 20.
                    If your proficiency in 'Attunement' school is at least 20,
                    you will automatically infuse the knowledge gained from the
                    vision to all open-minded (see (0.2)) allied players who
                    happen to be the same floor.

    Recognition     Identifies an item.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 20.
                    Shared spell (see above): Attunement / Mental Intrusion.

    Charm           Makes monsters in sight believe that you aren't an enemy,
                    preventing them most of the time from attacking you.
                    Monsters may resist or be immune to the initial cast.
                    While active, the spell drains your mana. The more monsters
                    you try to keep under control, the faster your mana is
                    depleted. If your distance to the monsters becomes too big
                    or your mana is depleted then the spell will break.
                    Sleeping monsters won't be affected or woken up by charm.
                    Monsters which have already been hurt cannot be charmed.
                    Psi-immune, unique, undead, empty-minded or non-living
                    monsters cannot be charmed either.
                    Monsters may have a chance to resist the attack, the higher
                    the more of the following abilities they possess:
                    Being smart, resisting confusion, being powerful.
                    (This spell uses CHARISMA to determine fail-rates!)
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 33.
    Stop Charm      Cease currently active charming effects.


- Astral Knowledge -
--------------------
The exclusive astral school for Maiar.
Instead of normal spell level, the spells of this school use an 'astral level'
to determine damage or effect. This astral level consists to equal parts of
your character level and your Astral Knowledge school level. This means that
a level 49 character with 1.000 in Astral Knowledge will still cast spells that
deal damage and have effects as if the spell was actually at level 25 (the
average value of 1 and 49). (Spell success chance uses the normal spell level
though, as all other magic schools do, not the astral level.)

    Power Bolt      Casts a bolt of electricity/mana/dispelling depending on
                    your alignment:
                    Still neutral -> electricity,
                    enlightened -> mana,
                    corrupted -> dispel.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 1.

    Power Ray       Casts a beam of electricity/light/darkness depending on
                    your alignment (see Power Bolt spell above).
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 5.

    Power Blast     Casts a ball of electricity/mana/dispelling depending on
                    your alignment (see Power Bolt spell above).
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 10.

    Relocation      Same as Word of Recall.
                    You may inscribe book '@R' etc. for the usual results.
                    Required skill level for first spell level: 22.

                                 Might summon additional monsters for each
                                 player who got teleported.

                    Required skill level for first spell level: 40.
                    This spell can be used even while blind.

    The Silent Force
                    Enlightened: Slows down monsters within sight
                                 and grants temporary time resistance.
                                 Note: This resistance does not stack
                                       with permanent resistance.
                    Corrupted: Increases your chance to strike critically.

                    This spell requires a character level of at least 62.


(6.8a) Mimic powers
-------------------
The monster spells ('S:' line in r_info.txt) are mostly also usable by a player
transforming into the monster via Mimicry skill, these spells are also called
'mimic powers', since they're not always spells in a strict sense of the word.
(In general, monsters' summoning spells are never available as mimic powers.)

All mimic powers use intelligence stat to determine their failure rate.
Their power usually depends on the level of the monster whose form the
character is using and on the character's own level.
As with magic spells, some mimic powers require a target, some don't.

(6.8b) Runes & Runemastery
--------------------------
Runes are magical symbols used to summon and manipulate the raw elemental
forces which sustain the world of life. They are the motivating force behind
the traditional systems of magic in TomeNET. The istari spell scrolls, for
example, are composed of a series of complicated runes which both protect the
mage from immediate harm, and create the desired effect: from fireballs to
magical satiation.

Runemasters are less methodical in their approach to magic. Having learned
to summon elemental forces without the aid of the traditional precautions,
limitations and potential inefficiencies of the complex istari spell system,
runemasters deal directly with the 'pure' substance of magic, and are limited
only by their wits, their strength and their skill. Runemasters only require
a physical rune to cast the Sign, Sigil, and Enhanced spell types.

This approach is not necessarily a safe one. Whereas traditional spells from
other schools of magic fail outright when something goes awry, the primordial
energy incumbent to a runespell instead erupts forth, damaging the caster in
the form of an elemental backlash.

As runemastery does not rely on books or spell scrolls to guide its magic,
runespells may be cast while blinded, although at increased rate of failure.
Spell failure likewise increases while stunned, or simply when attempting a
powerful spell. While an istar is always prevented from casting outside of
his or her ability, a runemaster may continue making spell attempts until the
backlash proves fatal. Runemasters are able to cast many kinds of spells, but
it's important to note that some are much more difficult to manage than
others. All runespells can either be projected at the world or a monster, or
directed at the caster for a different result. Runespells that are cast onto
the floor are 'glyphs' aka rune-traps, and prevent summoning as usual. Those
remain on the floor and explode if a monster triggers them. The runemaster can
retrieve the rune used to place the glyph with another cast (refunds the rune).

In addition, runespells fueled by physical runes may be used to emblazon
non-artifact equipment that is wielded by the runemaster. The strength and
success rates of these 'sigils' depend both on the skill of the runemaster
and the power of the item that would result. At most a runemaster may have
one armor sigil and one weapon sigil. Sigils vanish from the equipment when
dropped, sold, taken off, disarmed, etc. being linked directly to the
runemaster and the consumed physical rune for their power. Physical runes
may be activated to combine or decombine in stacks with other runes,
sharing level requirement, inscription and discount (use 'A').

Runemastery requires dexterous physical and intellectual manipulation of
the rune forms, requiring high INT and DEX character stats. For this reason,
runemasters also make decent thieves and fighters. To some extent,
runemasters will need to experiment to find out their own capabilities.


Runespells:
-----------
To cast a runespell, enter the m-key menu and select 'Draw a rune'.
(Note: The ability code for drawing a rune is 12.)

Runespells are made up of three components:
    1. A single rune or combination of two runes
    2. A spell modifier (minimized, brief, etc.)
    3. A spell type (glyph, bolt, ball, etc.)

Each component has different associated parameters, summarized in the menu.
When selecting runes, press return once you are finished, or enter the
maximum of two runes and continue to the modifier selection. The menu will
prompt for a direction if it is required after you're done. If the spell
targets an item, you must supply the letter corresponding to your choice of
equipment.


Runespell Failure & Backlash:
-----------------------------
Runemasters can only truly fail Sigil type (item-enhancing) spells. Spell
failure instead causes elemental backlash against the caster, while the
effects of the spell, if it is not a sigil type spell, resolve normally.
Resisting one's own spells can be an important factor for survival in
critical situations. For this reason, beginner runemasters are advised to
use basic elemental spells that they can easily acquire the according
resistance for or stick to the Mana element, which has few adverse effects.

Intelligence, dexterity, and skill level affect spell failure rates for
runespells. Runespell type generally governs the level of a spell, and is
further modified by the runespell modifier. Highly experienced and talented
runemasters may achieve 0% spell failure rates, but should be cautioned
against stunned and blinded statuses, which will each increase runespell
failure, and thus the chance of backlash directly.


Other Uses for Runes:
---------------------
Runes are required to cast Sign, Sigil and Enhanced spells. The Glyph type
spell may be cast again to disarm a glyph and recover the original physical
rune at no additional rune cost. Sigil spells on the other hand consume a
rune forever, remaining in effect only so long as the runemaster continues
to wear/wield the enhanced equipment. An additional sigil spell on the same
equipment overrides the previous one, consuming a new rune as before.


Macros & Spell Construction:
----------------------------
Runemastery macros look like this (key translation in parenthesis):
(Note: m@12\r invokes the m-key menu command for 'Draw a rune'.)

Targetted runespells use the following format:
    \e)*tm@12\r[a-f]\r[a-g][a-g]-  (rune, return, modifier, type, target)
    \e)*tm@12\r[a-f][a-f][a-g][a-g]-  (rune, rune, modifier, type, target)

Non-targetted runespells use the format:
    \e)m@18\r[a-f]\r[a-g][a-g]  (rune, return, modifier, type)
    \e)m@18\r[a-f][a-f][a-g][a-g]  (rune, rune, modifier, type)

Note that you must choose at least one and up to two runes, one modifier,
and one type. If you choose two runes for a spell, the \r is not required.
[a-f] and [a-g] denote the choices of a letter from a to f or h,
inclusive, which represents a rune or a modifier or type, respectively.
ie. There are six base runes, so [a-f] represents a choice from rune 1-6.


Examples:
---------
Here is a single rune example, invoking the element 'light' (rune 'a'):
    \e)*tm@12\ra\raa-  (light--return--minimized--bolt)

This spell launches a minimized bolt of light, a targetted projection
affecting up to a single opponent, dealing light damage if it successfully
connects.

A fire ball spell might look like this (runes 'a' and 'e' for 'fire'):
    \e)*tm@12\raedd-  (light--chaos--moderate--ball)

Note the following macro produces an identical effect (runes 'e' and 'a'):
    \e)*tm@12\readd-  (chaos--light--moderate--ball)

To increase the radius of the ball, adjust the modifier to something that
sounds bigger, ie. choose a spell modifier that increases radius.

A maximized ball of fire:
    \e)*tm@12\raegd-  (light--chaos--maximized--ball)

Or an expanded ball of fire, to produce something much larger:
    \e)*tm@12\raeed-  (light--chaos--expanded--ball)

Note that failure rate may become an obstacle to advanced spells at low
level. Low failure types, modifiers, and elements are recommended.

Advanced runemasters may wish to create macro sets which construct spells
on the fly, swap macro sets containing preset runespells, or set up
combinations of macros to chain together spells quickly and efficiently.
Spells with a lowered casting time might even be combined in one macro,
creating a 'dual-cast' effect (especially true with the 'brief' modifier).

Note that every modifier has drawbacks associated with the benefits of using
it: higher cost, level, reduced damage, increased failure rates- check the
specifics in the m-key menu before you create a new macro. It is recommended
to experiment with new spells in Bree or even the Training Tower for safety.


Auto-retaliation:
-----------------
If you inscribe @O[a-g][a-g] on a rune in your inventory, you will retaliate
with a spell of the selected modifier and type. For example, if you set the
inscription to @Oad on a rune of light, the 'ball’ spell type will be
selected, with a 'minimized' spell modifier.

Although you can set most spells for retaliation, some spells may make poor
choices for auto-retaliation. Retaliation is disabled completely if you
select a non-damaging runespell (most Sign spells, and all Sigil spells).


Hints:
------
The casting adjective will further elaborate on the difficulty of a spell
compared to your skill. Ideally, choose spells where the average outcome
is 'efficiently', or better, or cast while at near full HP and with the
according resistance. You can use the mkey * display to see a list of spell
failure rates, or go through the macro wizard to display the specific
attributes of spells.

Beginners may wish to play a race with intrinsic resistance to their element
or elements of choice, or choose combinations of skills to produce a 'base'
element, and purchase rings/amulets from the magic shop to resist these.
For example, light is resisted by elves, so an elf runemaster who trains in
light runemastery may evoke runes of light relatively safely. Training chaos
runemastery as well would unlock the combination element fire, a 'base'
element, and Rings of Fire Resistance are readily available in magic shops.

Note that different elemental damage types are reduced more or less when
resisted, see (5.6) Resistances & caps, Immunities, Susceptibilities for info.


(6.8c) Runespell Tables
-----------------------
Runemastery covers a breadth of effects, catalogued in the tables below.

Elements
--------
A table of every projectable element accessed through one or two rune skills.
Weight is the relative base damage for an element, which is similar to the
maximum damage caps per element listed in section (5.6). This value is averaged
towards half the magic damage cap of 1600 (so 800, by level 50) to produce the
approximate damage cap for any given runespell. ie. Fire damage >> Mana damage!
Artifacts and certain items may be unaffected by the various elemental effects.
See section (5.6) for more information about elemental attacks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rune     | Rune     | Element        | Weight | Status Effects | Affected Items

Chaos    | Mana     | Plasma         |   933  | Stun           | Many Items

Spell Modifiers
---------------
A table of every runespell modifier. Modifiers alter the nature of a runespell,
influencing level, cost, fail rate, damage, casting time, radius, and duration.
The Enhanced modifier (noted with a (&) in the Name column) requires at least
one appropriate rune to be present in your inventory for the spell to be cast.
Enhanced Signs are an exception to this rule, but only when retrieving a glyph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name         | Lvl | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimized    | + 0 | Best efficiency, worst damage, poor radius and duration.
Extended     | + 2 | Good efficiency, poor damage, best duration.
Compressed   | + 3 | Good efficiency and duration, worst radius.
Moderate     | + 5 | Balanced spell parameters.
Expanded     | + 7 | Poor efficiency and duration, best radius. Projects Signs.
Brief        | + 8 | Poor efficiency, good damage, worst duration. Half energy!
Maximized    | +10 | Worst efficiency, best damage, good radius and duration.
Enhanced (&) | +10 | Unique spell parameters, see Enhanced Spell Types.

Spell Types
-----------
A table of basic runespell types. Type controls the form of the runespell, also
influencing level, cost, fail rate, damage, casting time, radius, and duration.
Spell types followed by a (&) consume a rune (cost 1 rune) to cast. Sign (*)

(6.8d) Spell failure rate
-------------------------
The chance to not successfully cast a spell, aka the spell fail rate is shown
in percent when browsing a spell scroll/crystal.
For mimic spells, the failure rate is shown next to their spell name in the
mimic power menu (accessible with 'm').

The fail rate of a spell depends on..

Magic schools:
    Nearly all magic spells depend on the spell level and your intelligence,
    some spells however use wisdom instead of intelligence, those spells are
    designated in (6.8) in their spell description.
    Currently, the only magic spell using wisdom is 'Genocide'.
Prayer schools:
    All holy spells depend on the spell level and your wisdom.
Occult schools:
    Some shadow and most spirit spells use wisdom, the others intelligence.
Mindcraft schools:
    All mind spells depend on the spell level and your intelligence,
    except for 'Charm' which uses charisma.
Druidic schools:
    All druidic spells depend on the spell level and your wisdom.
Astral school:
    Some astral spells depend on the spell level and wisdom, some on the spell
    level and intelligence, as designated in (6.8) in the spell descriptions.

Runecraft:
    Runespells use dexterity, intelligence and spell level to determine failure
    rate.

Mimic powers:
    All mimic powers use intelligence to determine fail rate.

In general, when you learn a new spell that starts at a high fail rate, you
will observe a great improvement just by further training the spell's school to
increase the spell's level. Increasing your attributes (depending on what this
particular spell uses, see list above) will also help.
At a certain point however, usually when the spell's fail chance is already
rather low, the spell fail rate might not go down further from increasing its
level. At that point the only thing you can do to further reduce the spell fail
rate is to increase the stat that the spell uses.

A spell failure rate of 0% means that you will always successfully cast the
spell. However, certain status effects can increase your failure rate
temporarily or even completely prevent spell-casting, even if your fail rate
used to be 0%:

-Blindness
 Some spells can be cast while blind (will say so in the spell description)
-Confusion
 Some spells can be cast while confused (will say so in the spell description)
-Stun
 Stun will increase your fail chance by 15%, heavy stun even by 25%.
 When you're knocked out you can of course not cast any spells (or do anything
 at all).



(6.9) Parties, Iron Teams, Guilds
----------------------------------
Press 'P' to display the party menu.
Here you can..


Parties:
--------
-Create or rename a party
    Allows you to create a party if you aren't in one yet, or rename your
    current party, provided you are the party owner.
    In a party you will share experience points if you are within 7 character
    levels to each other and on the same dungeon/tower level respectively
    the same worldmap/wilderness sector. A slight experience bonus is applied
    for killing monsters in a party!
    The range is 11 levels instead of 7 for "winners" (queens/kings/empresses/
    emperors).
    Winners don't share experience with non-winner characters. They do share
    experience with fallen winners though, within 7 levels.

    Monsters will usually remember the highest player they have met and not
    give experience nor kill credit to players who are more than the 8
    (exp-sharing level limit plus 1) levels away from it, 12 for winners.
    So, avoid being on the same dungeon floor as teammates whose character
    level differs by more than 8 levels (12 for winners) from yours.

    Similarly, a player who received a power-up spell from another player
    who is higher in levels than the allowed difference of 8 (12 for winners),
    may cause that player to not gain any experience or kill credit until a
    number of turns (usually 200) has passed and the buff spell has worn off.
    Kings/queens/emperors/empresses are freed from this restriction.

    Note that there are two exceptions to these rules:
    -Morgoth, Lord of Darkness (Game boss)
    -The Great Pumpkin (Halloween special event monster)
    These two always give credit, no matter what level difference the players
    have.

    Special case: A player who lost levels due to death plays together with
    another player who is now just within range of his lowered level.
    Example: Player A was level 45, but lost 5 levels due to dying twice and is
    now level 40. He teams up with player B whose level is a regular 33.
    What happens depends on the server settings, there are three rules:
    a) the difference of player A's real level and his current level counts in
       50%. So he'd be treated like a 40 + (45-40)/2 = 42 (rounded down) player
       and player B wouldn't get any exp since he's not level 35 or higher.
    b) if player B is way below player A's top level (default is more than 5
       levels beyond the level limit for sharing experience) the exp he gets
       will be cut down depending on the difference between player B's current
       level and player A's top level, but he still receives exp.
    c) the server only looks at the highest reached level and compares the
       current level of all team members to it. So it would compare player B's
       33 to player A's 45 when it wants to determine if player B receives a
       share of exp from player A, which is more than 7 levels apart, so player
       B gets nothing.
    The rule effective on the official servers is b), so teaming up with
    everlasting characters that have lost a bunch of levels shouldn't be much
    of an issue.

    A party owner may set access to one or more of his houses to 'party access'
    (use 'h' key next to the door) to allow all party members to access that
    house.
    If the owner dies, the whole party is disbanded. (Exception: On a server
    running 'Ironman' rules the party ownership will be transferred to another
    player in the party automatically. See (8.6) for more information about
    Ironman settings. Within the 'Ironman Deep Dive Dungeon', party ownership
    is also transferred in the same manner. See (4.13) for more information
    about the persistent "Ironman Deep Dive Challenge" event.)
    Be aware that his houses will be wiped too, so the party might lose quite
    an amount of items that way.

    'Anti-magic fields' of fellow party members have greatly reduced effect
    on spell-users in the same party, to allow the party to still be a vital
    combination. Usage of magic devices by party members is not hindered.

    If you choose 'Create or rename a party' while already being in a party,
    you will be prompted to rename the party. Only the party owner can do this.

    Specialty: Everlasting and non-everlasting players can team up while
               inside the Nether Realm.

-Create or rename an 'Iron Team' party
    Allows you to create an iron team if you aren't in one yet, or rename your
    current iron team, provided you are the party owner.
    An iron team is like a party with the following differences:
    An 'Iron Team' can only be formed with newly created characters. Its
    members will only get experience for killing monsters if ALL members
    are online and on the same dungeon level!

    If you choose this while already being in an iron team, you will be
    prompted to rename it. Only the iron team owner can do this.

-Add a player to party / Add yourself to party
    If you are in a party you will see the option "Add a player to party",
    allowing you to add more players to your party.
    This can be done by all members of the party, not just by the owner!

    If you aren't in a party, you will see "Add yourself to party" instead!
    This will allow you to add this character to a party, provided that at
    least one of your other characters is already a member of it.
    This does not work for cross-adding to nether realm parties.
    It only works for cross-adding to IDDC parties if your already partied
    character is currently in the IDDC.

-Delete a player from your party
    This can only be done by the party owner.
    Note that if you remove a player from an iron team and his character has
    already gained some experience he will be unable to join again.
    If the owner removes himself from his own party, the whole party is
    disbanded.

-Leave your current party
    Note that if you leave an iron team and your character has already gained
    experience you will be unable to join again.
    If the owner leaves his own party, the whole party is disbanded.


Guilds:
-------
-Create a new guild
    You can create a guild with a character that is at least level 30.
    This costs 2,000,000 Au. A guild will stay, even if the owner dies.
    The guild creator will receive a 'Guild Key' which designates him as the
    guild master. The guild master doesn't need to carry the key around with
    him but can just safely deposit it in a house.
    In case the guild master dies, another guild member may fetch the key to
    become the new guild master.
    Only one character per account can be a guild master.

    A guild offers a dedicated guild chat, so players in a guild can organize
    themselves in diving parties and still have a global chat if needed.

    Guilds may have a guild hall, see (6.9a) below for more information.

    The following slash commands are available to manage your guild, only the
    guild master may use them:

    /guild_adder <name of another player>
        Allows that player permanently to add other players to the guild too.
        Use the command a second time to revoke his rights again.
        Note that this only works if you have enabled the guild flag 'adder',
        see the '/guild_cfg' command below.

    /guild_cfg [<flag> [<value]]
        Shows you your current guild configuration if used without any parms
        and allows you to change it by specifying a flag.

    The same functionality as provided by these commands can simply be
    accessed by pressing SHIFT+P and then choosing 'e)'.

    NOTE: If you want to rename your guild that can be done for a fee that is
    as high as actually creating a guild, in the mayor's office in Bree.

-Add player to guild / Add yourself to guild
    Only the guild master or a designated 'adder' can do this.

    If you are in a guild you will see the option "Add a player to guild",
    which allows you to add another player to this guild. You need to be either
    the guild master or one of the designated 'adders' to do this (and the
    'adders' guild flag must be enabled).

    If you aren't in a guild, you will see "Add yourself to guild" instead!
    This will allow you to add this character to a guild, provided that at
    least one of your other characters is either the guild master or one of the
    'adders' designated by the guild master (and the 'adders' guild flag must
    be enabled).

-Remove player from guild
    Only the guild master can do this. If all members are removed including
    the guild master, the guild ceases to exist.
    If the guild master removes himself, it's like he leaves the guild
    (see below).

-Leave guild
    If the last member leaves, the whole guild is disbanded.
    If the guild master leaves the guild, the guild becomes leaderless.
    The next player from that guild who grabs the guild key becomes the new
    guild master.

A player of a leaderless guild who grabs the guild key becomes the new
guild master. Keys are indestructible, they can be lost though..

While a guild is leaderless, three restrictions apply:
    1) No new members can be added to the guild.
    2) Items and gold cannot be picked up from the guild hall anymore.
    3) The guild will cease to exist if it is leaderless for more than a week!


PvP outside of the dedicated 'PvP' character mode:
--------------------------------------------------
-Specify player to attack
    Now you are hostile to that player and you will hurt each other like
    when fighting a monster (this includes auto-retaliating and targetting).
    You can kill each other for real this way, so this is NOT recommended!

-Make peace
    Make peace with a player you are hostile too. Better pay attention that
    your opponent makes peace too.


(6.9a) Guild halls
------------------
A guild may have a guild hall. That is a house owned by the guild, which will
persist until the guild is disbanded or it is sold by the guild master.

To get a guild hall, the current guild master must buy a house and transfer
ownership to the guild. He does this by standing next to the house door,
pressing 'h' key for house operations, and then choose '(2) Change house owner'
followed by '(2) Guild'.
Note that 'list' houses (store-like houses) are not allowed to become guild
halls. You need to pick the other type of house (the one with open area inide).

After the ownership has been changed to the guild, the house no longer counts
to houses owned by the guild master. So it does not affect his house limit nor
will it be wiped if the guild master dies.

The guild master is the only person who can change back ownership of the guild
hall or even sell it if the guild for example wants to migrate to a bigger
guild hall.

The appromimate guild hall location can be viewed by all guild members by
pressing SHIFT+P and then choosing 'e)'.

The door of a guild hall is displayed in violet colour to all eligible members.
Note that a guild hall can, same as party-accessible houses, have restrictions
put on it such as minimum level required to enter, et cetera. These can only be
installed or changed by the current guild master.



(6.10) Magic devices, skill and ability
---------------------------------------
The player's "Magic Device" ability in the character overview screen is
calculated from a base ability depending on race/class, your intelligence, and
to the largest part from the 'Magic Device' skill in the skill screen ('G').
It determines how well a character can make use of magical devices such as
wands, staves, rods and activatable items (see (5.9a)).

The Magic Device ability is not limited to a maximum value, although the
player won't be able to increase it infinitely.
While a low magic device ability might be sufficient to use supportive devices
during breaks from combat, you will probably want superb, heroic or even
legendary magic device ability if you intend to use magic devices as weapons
in combat effectively. Otherwise your failure chance might be too high and
therefore your damage output lacking.

In detail, the magic device ability does this...
-makes it easier to use wands, staves and rods and to activate items.
 There's always a slim chance to succeed even if your magic device ability is
 really bad.
 Items that have higher base item level (from k_info.txt) determines how
 difficult it is to activate a magic device. This level is not the (often
 higher) level displayed on the item that you see when looking at
 it in-game (ie the level shown in curly brackets).
 Confusion reduces your chance, EASY_USE (rods of charging/of the istari)
 greatly increases it.

The 'Magic Device' skill does the following...
-increases the power of magic devices.
-makes rods take less time to recharge.
-helps to reduce effects of UN_POWER attacks (does not protect the remaining
 duration of a form gained from a ring of polymorphing).
-helps to increase the duration on polymorph-rings when they are forged.
-makes it easier to recharge items provided you don't use scrolls to do that,
 but a real magic device (some artifacts can be activated for recharging).

Magic Device skill and ability have no effect on the damage output of traps
loaded with a magic device or on recharge time of rods that are loaded inside
trap kits.

Rods have more high level item types and hence are harder to use on average,
staves and wands have more lower level types available in comparison.
Wands are always used directional (with a target), staves are always used
without a target, rods and other activatable items have both types.
Wands and rods that cast elemental bolt spells or magic missiles have a small
chance of actually casting a beam instead, on each activation.

Equippable items and true artifacts may have higher levels in general, but are
actually much easier to activate than normal magic devices. (For true artifacts
their base level from a_info.txt counts, ie what is displayed at
'Found around depth:' in ~6.)



(6.11) Parrying and blocking
-----------------------------
There are a couple of ways to reduce damage taken. One is simply to have high
armour class (see (5.12) for details), another one is 'Dodging' skill (see
(6.2) for details).
This paragraph is about parrying/blocking only. Note that the chance values
given below do not always apply as is, but sometimes depend on the the attack
type and especially on a little bit of randomness when your character chooses
which defense method it actually uses (block or parry) - for details about this
and about all damage reduction mechanisms in general and the order/chance they
are applied, make sure you also read (5.12).

For melee fighters that use weapons or shields, two more abilities can help:
Parrying enemy attacks with a weapon, and blocking attacks with a shield.
Press 'm' and choose 'Check block/parry chance' to see your actual ability
to block or parry. In order to have this option appear in your 'm' menu, you
need a combat skill greater than zero.

Depending on the server version you might see textual descriptions instead of
raw numbers:
"You cannot parry at the moment."               You aren't wielding a weapon.
"You have almost no chance of parrying."        Below 5% chance.
"You have a slight chance of parrying."         Below 10% chance.
"You have a significant chance of parrying."    Below 20% chance.
"You have a good chance of parrying."           Below 30% chance.
"You have a very good chance of parrying."      Below 40% chance.
"You have an excellent chance of parrying."     Below 50% chance.
"You have a superb chance of parrying."         50% chance or better.
                                                (51% is highest reachable)
Note: Above 30% can only be reached in defensive combat stance without a
      shield equipped. (Because if no shield is equipped, defensive combat
      stance which normally bolsters block chance will transfer that defensive
      advantage to the weapon instead, increasing the parry chance.)
      Also your class needs to be fairly skilled at parrying (see below.)

Depending on the server version you might see textual descriptions instead of
raw numbers:
"You cannot block at the moment."               You aren't wielding a shield.
"You have almost no chance of blocking."        Below 5% chance.
"You have a slight chance of blocking."         Below 14% chance.
"You have a significant chance of blocking."    Below 23% chance
"You have a good chance of blocking."           Below 33% chance.
"You have a very good chance of blocking."      Below 43% chance.
"You have an excellent chance of blocking."     Below 48% chance.
"You have a superb chance of blocking."         48-50% chance (the highest
                                                reachable).

Note: To achieve an extraordinarily high block chance above 30% you'll
      have to enter a defensive combat stance, and your class should be
      fairly skilled at blocking and/or your shield should have a high
      block chance. See the note below.


Additional information:
-----------------------
Classes do differently well at parrying and blocking. To find out more, see
the class overview table at the end of section (6.5).

Parrying/blocking might get boosted/modified under certain circumstances,
such as PvP or defending from a trap you accidentally set off.


More on Parrying
----------------
The larger a weapon, the more you can parry. Without a weapon, you cannot
parry at all.
A 1-handed weapon will parry less often than a 1 1/2-hander (SHOULD2H), and
that one less often than a 2-handed weapon (MUST2H).
If you wield a 1-hand weapon WITHOUT a shield which "feels especially easy to
swing" (COULD2H), you'll also get an extra parry bonus.
Increasing weaponmastery improves your parry chance; dual-wielding improves it
too, provided that you aren't 'flexibility-encumbered' (compare (5.5)).


More on Blocking
----------------
Some effects that normal armour usually doesn't protect from can actually be
blocked, for example magical breath, ball or bolt attacks.
The bigger a shield, the more you can block. Depending on server settings,
the actual block base chance will usually be displayed as a percentage in []
brackets behind the shield's name, where AC is located for other types of
armour.
This base chance in many cases applies as is to standard melee combat IF your
character tries to block instead of parrying (compare (5.12)), but is sometimes
modified depending on the type of an incoming attack: When deflecting bolts
from bolt traps or when in PvP combat blocking receives an additional bonus.

Parrying and blocking can both be affected by combat stances - see (6.2) for
"Combat Stances" skill.



(6.12) Fighting/shooting techniques
-----------------------------------
Depending on your class, your character is able to gain access to certain
fighting techniques that cost 'Stamina' to use. Warriors, rangers, paladins
and mimics will learn all of them eventually, while rogues may learn sprint
and taunt, and some rogue-specific techniques.
Similarly, by training archery your character will gain access to a couple of
ranged techniques.

All techniques are accessable via 'm' key, also see (3.7a).

The time your character learns a certain technique varies, depending on your
class, see the table at the bottom of this section. The order in which they
are learnt is the same though.

The techniques are as follows:

    Fighting techniques:
    --------------------
    Sprint              7 stamina
        Your character will be able to move faster, so you can catch up to
        runners and other monsters that avoid you. Note: This does not affect
        your SPEED stat, nor has anything to do with 'running' (shift+dir),
        but simply means that moving one step will only cost you half a turn of
        energy, allowing you to move two steps during each of your turns
        instead of one! So the ONLY thing 'Sprint' affects is normal walking.
        (Advanced note: Certain hit & run tactics aka kiting might also become
        more effective accordingly, since half of your turn could be utilized
        by the auto-retaliator if you keep time intervals between each step.)
        Running (shift + directional keys) is not affected.
        (Starting to sprint does not cost energy.)
    Taunt               2 stamina
        Attempts to draw attention of humanoid mobs, causing them to attack
        you. Might require more than one try sometimes until they fall for it,
        depending on the monster. Some won't be affected at all even.
        Most common targets are typically shaman and priest class monsters.
        Note that this can also be used to make scared monsters agressive,
        and -if you and an ally both stand next to the same monster- to draw
        its attention from your ally and make it attack you instead.
        (Taunting costs a quarter of a turn of energy.)
    Distract            1 stamina
        Your character will attempt to appear wimpy and a non-worthy target to
        adjacent monsters, in hope of making them attack another player who
        must be standing next to you and also next to the monster, instead of
        you. Not all monsters can be fooled though. Some monsters might resist,
        but probably fall for it if you give it another try.
        This skill is useless if there is no team mate next to you (and the
        monster).
        (Distracting costs half a turn of energy.)
    Track Animals       3 stamina    (rangers only)
        Read animal tracks, disclosing their whereabouts in your surroundings.
    Spin                8 stamina
        A sweep that hits all adjacent monsters and may stun them if they don't
        resist. You might even perform more than one complete sweep circle,
        hitting some or all monsters multiple times, based on your number of
        blows/round!
        (Spinning around costs a turn of energy.)
    Berserk             10 stamina   (warriors only)
        Similar to potions of berserk strength, also giving you +1 blow/round.
        (Entering berserk rage does not cost energy.)

    Rogue-specific fighting techniques:
    -----------------------------------
    Apply Poison        -
        Searches your inventory for a potion of poison or a mushroom of poison,
        or of unhealth, and spends it to apply poison to any melee weapon that
        you have equipped.
        If you have two weapons equipped, it is applied to both. This technique
        does not work without a weapon. If you take off a weapon the poison
        branding will fade away.
        The poison will only last for a short while, so it's best to apply it
        before engaging in a fight.
    Perceive Noise      3 stamina
        Listen carefully to every sound in your surroundings, thereby locating
        creatures. Some entities are so quiet that they cannot be detected this
        way though.
    Flash Bomb          4 stamina
        You throw down a flash bomb that causes a flash of light, blinding
        your opponents for a short time, giving you opportunity to escape or
        kill them off while they are running around in confused state.
        See (4.12) for which monsters are (not) affected by blindness.
        (Throwing a flash bomb costs a turn of energy.)
    Shadow Run          10 stamina, kings/queens only!
        You will move at blinding speed, your silhouette turning shadowy.
        Ranged attacks will hardly be able to pin you down, you will act at
        increased speed and you cannot be intercepted.
        You can even perform a backstab opening attack out of this state.
        Performing actions that require calm movements or anything that
        distracts or disrupts your attention from focussing on keeping up your
        movement, or attacking someone/something will break shadow running -
        it will not wear off on its own but last indefinitely until broken.
        Taking damage doesn't break it, but taking sanity damage can break it.
        Suffering from status effects such as confusion/blindness/stun breaks
        it too.
        Note that stamina does not regenerate while shadow running.
        Shadow running includes sprinting, ie moving at half energy cost.
        (Starting to shadow-run does not cost energy.)

    Shooting techniques:
    --------------------
    Flare Missile       2 stamina      (4.000 Archery)
        Prepares an oil-drenched shot for the next time you shoot, which will
        burn brightly, lighting up the area where it lands or hits a wall.
        If that spot is inside a room, the whole room will be lit up.
        If it hits a monster, instead of lighting up an area the monster will
        absorb it and suffer extra fire damage.
        This technique consumes 1 flask of oil and your shot/arrow/bolt.
        Note that this destroys magic ammunition too.
        (Preparing a flare missile costs a turn of energy.)
    Precision Shot      7 stamina      (8.000 Archery)
        You aim your next shot carefully, costing you a turn. The next shot
        you fire however will receive a great damage bonus, even more so
        against fleeing opponents. Useful opener against sleeping monsters.
        Aiming will be interrupted by most actions, including walking.
        (Aiming precisely costs a turn of energy.)
    Craft Ammunition    -              (10.000 Archery)
        Craft ammunition for your currently equipped ranged weapon from
        bones, skeletons or broken sticks in your inventory or from a pile of
        rubble (':') next to your character.
        If you wield a bow or crossbow, you'll need to have bones, skeletons or
        broken sticks and it'll create arrows if you wield a bow or bolts if
        you wield a crossbow.
        If you wield a sling, you'll need to stand next to rubble and it'll
        create sling ammunition from it.
        The quality mainly depends on your archery skill and somewhat on your
        ranged mastery skill, but is still somewhat random.
        If you want to create larger stacks of the same type of ammunition,
        collect a large stack of materials and use the skill on that stack
        (the total weight of that inventory slot determines the stack size).
        The level of the raw materials has no effect on the outcome.
        (Creating ammunition costs a turn of energy.)
    Double Shot         1 stamina*     (16.000 Archery)
        (*: 20% chance per turn of actively using it to drain 1 stamina.)
        Toggle, making you enter or leave double shot mode. While active, you
        will fire 2 projectiles at once on each shot, dealing way less damage
        than a single shot though. Useful to eradicate weak critters.
        Note: If your stamina drops below 1 you will continue to fire
              normally, but not leave double shot mode. That means as soon as
              you get stamina back you'll start firing double shots again.
              To permanently leave double shot mode, you have to toggle it
              explicitely in the 'm' menu.
        (Double-shooting does not cost more energy than shooting normally.)
    Barrage             9 stamina      (25.000 Archery)
        Prepares to fire a powerful multi-shot which will cost you half a
        turn. It stuns the target (if it doesn't resist stunning attacks).
        Because 6 shots are fired at once you will need at least as many
        projectiles in your quiver in order to use it.
        (Firing a barrage costs half a turn of energy.)

    Note: The ability 'fire-till-kill' is available to any class and not
    considered to be a special shooting technique. It appears directly in the
    'm' key menu. See (5.2a) for details.

Stamina regenerates slowly over time, faster while resting. Your CONstitution
stat and 'Health' skill will further improve regeneration speed.

Different classes learn fighting techniques at the following levels, if at all:
            | Sprint Taunt Distract Percv.N. Flashbomb Spin Berserk Shadowrun
------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
Warrior     |    2     4                                 6     20

(6.13) PvP mode
---------------
PvP stands for "Player vs player". This describes the act of player characters
fighting each other, usually to the death.
In that regard, it is quite different to the 'blood bond' duel, which always
ends without anyone getting hurt for real.

If you want to fight other players to death in a real pvp match, create a
'pvp-mode' character. It's an option during the character creation process,
much like 'everlasting mode' or 'normal mode'.

PvP-mode characters can use the /pvp command to enter/leave the pvp arena.
This arena also releases monsters from time to time. The entry point of a
player is random, because he gets teleported on arrival.

Note that you don't HAVE to use the pvp arena. PvP characters are always
automatically hostile to all other PvP characters everywhere, for example you
could surprise an opponent in a normal dungeon while he tries to kill a unique
monster for items. The only safe zones are towns.

Before you go and fight others to the death, look at your inventory. You will
see a parchment "Gladiator's Entrance". When you turn this in at the mayor's
office in Bree, you will get a semi-random excellent item for free, to start
your career with. Semi-random because it partially depends on your skill point
distribution, so before turning in your parchment for an item at the office,
make sure you hit SHIFT+G and distribute your skill points to your liking.
For details about how this item is generated, see (8.5) Reward item creation,
it actually uses the same mechanics.

PvP-mode characters are called 'Gladiators' and use special rulesets that make
it easier to rise in levels and less of a hassle when you get actually killed
by an opponent! The special rules that apply are as follows:

-PVP chars have only one life and no ghost, ie are erased on death same as
 no-ghost chars. However, they play more fast-paced and are quickly brought up
 again. The purpose of PvP chars is to fight other players to the death
 without remorse, which would otherwise be an unacceptable loss if done with
 regular characters (who can at least use Blood Bond scrolls for friendly duels
 though).
-yellow name in chat, yellow * marker in @-list, completely yellow entry
 in @-list if viewed by another PvP mode char.
-start at level 10 and with about 10000 Au.
-reach level 30 at most.
-cannot team up or exchange goods with non-PVP chars.
-will automatically be hostile to all other PVP chars, except for towns which
 are safe zones!
-will always ESP all other PvP chars as well as see their location in @-list.
-get no credit for killing uniques (hence cannot become king/queen), cannot use
 static artifacts, can gain loot and money from killing monsters but no exp.
-gain no exp from any other source except killing other PvP characters.
 Lower level PvP opponents will give less exp than equal/higher.
-if a pvp char dies to a monster or trap, all nearby pvp chars may receive a
 kill credited depending on the number of kills that character had.
-walk faster by default, similar to 'sprint' fighting technique.
-cannot chase PvP chars _much_ lower then himself by entering their dungeon
 level, because he will get auto-recalled then (anti-chicken).
-will get rewards (similar to highlander tournament) for reaching high/top
 level or killing an amount of opposing gladiators (other PVP chars).
-when killed at high level, the player will get a deed on his next PvP
 character he logs on with, which can be exchanged for an extra item.
 The highest level deed (obtained when dying at level 30) can be received on a
 non-pvp char too.
-mimicry users gain one free transformation of their choice on (multiple)
 levelup, and also learn forms 3x as fast as regular characters.
-diminishing effect on healing: if you spam heal pots, the effect will lessen
 more and more. over time, it returns to normal. entering a town will reset it
 too.
-temporary speed buffs (potions, mimic powers, spells) have no effect.
-teleportation will be suppressed during combat, phase door is allowed though.
-while in a fight with another pvp-char, you cannot teleport away easily
 (takes about 30 seconds to wear off, or just enter a town to reset).
-PvP characters are unaffected by certain effects caused by other players:
 Hallucination, Life force drain (exp drain), Stat drain, Nexus scrambling.
-They may not own more than one house.

Note: Item rewards depend on your character, see (8.5) for more information
      about item rewards.



(6.14) Miscellaneous character properties
-----------------------------------------
Characters also have the following miscellaneous properties:

-Sex
-Age
-Height
-Weight
-Social Class

These currently have no effect in the game, and modifiying them has no effect
either: Traps of aging, shrinking or growing may change these values but will
not affect the gameplay in any way.



(6.15) Character sheet boni page
--------------------------------
This page of the character overview displays equipment and intrinsic boni.
The four tables list resistances, miscellaneous flags, numeric boni, and
slays/brands/esp, complete with a header/footer to identify each column. Each
worn item has a header based on equipment slot, notated [a-n]. Class/race/form
boni use the @ header. A representation of any equipment worn and current form
occupy the footer. The columns between each header/footer pair display boni,
which correlate to the row title, shown to the left of each table.

A dark grey row title or column header indicates no relevant modifications to
that particular boni, or an empty equipment slot. An equipped column is
highlighted grey by default, unless the item has hidden properties, in which
case both the column header and unknown boni will be highlighted yellow. A
column representing a cursed item will have a red header. When a particular
boni is applied to your character, the row title will highlight white, unless
the boni is detrimental, in which case the title may appear yellow or red. A
gold row title indicates an improved boni, such as immunity, sustained stats or
lite source, or a maximum value, such as for stealth, luck, or AM Field.

Here is an explanation of the common glyphs which may occupy a row/column grid:
- (red)         Susceptibility, HP/MP Drain, Random Teleportation
+ (red)         Aggravation
+ (white)       Resistance, Miscellaneous Flags, Slay+ESP, Brand+Aura
* (gold)        Immunity, Anti-Teleportation (yellow), Kill/ESP (white)
# (green)       A number, dark green adds 10, gold indicates sustenance.
# (red)         A number, red subtracts 10.
s (gold)        A sustained ability without numerical modification.
s (white)       Slay (2x)
k (white)       Kill (3x)
e (white)       ESP, Full ESP applies one to all the ESPs in that item's column
a (white)       Aura
b (white)       Brand

Some row specific glyphs:
s (gold)        Immunity to Cuts (shards row)
~ (blue)        Swimming (levitation row)
# (green)       Pass Forests (levitation row)



(7) Tactics & strategy
======================

(7.1) Preparing the inventory for diving into the dungeon
---------------------------------------------------------
Depending on your character level you will always want to stock up on certain
items before entering the dungeon. Here are some guidelines for your
inventory:


Beginners (level 1)
-------------------
+ Some Rations of Food, one or more Flask of Oil
  Know that there are traps that can empty your stomach or drain the fuel of
  your light. If you don't have supplies then you might be doomed.
+ Potion of Heroism
  because it can approximately double the hitpoints of level 1 characters
  (depending on race/class) for a short period of time as well as greatly
  improve the chance to hit the opponent, which will raise the fighting
  potential for example against enemies like Farmer Maggot's dogs. Even if
  your character has a decent amount of Hit Points, these potions raise your
  fighting abilities a good deal.
+ Potion of Cure Light Wounds
  They become useless quickly while you gain some character levels since they
  don't heal very many HP (Hit Points). At the beginning they are very helpful
  however.
+ Scroll of Phase Door
  This one does a short range teleportation, allowing you to escape if you are
  surrounded or get some distance between an enemy and yourself, allowing you
  to shoot him on distance using a ranged weapon. Since Phase Door teleports
  randomly, you might have to read several of them quickly after each other
  until you come out in a good position.
+ Maybe a scroll of Word of Recall
  If read in the dungeon it will far-distance teleport you back to the town.
  This allows you to quickly "dive" deep and gain levels and find items that
  can be sold for good cash, then read Word of Recall to quickly get back home
  with all the loot without having to start an annoying search for the
  staircases leading upwards back to town.


Low level character (up to 15)
------------------------------
+ Several Rations of Food or Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger, some Flasks of Oil
+ Some Potions of Heroism
+ Some Potions of Cure Serious Wounds / Critical Wounds
  Note that Potions of Cure Wounds also remove certain effects like blindness
  and confusion, depending on the exact potion type (light/serious/critical).
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ Some Scrolls of Word of Recall
+ Some Scrolls of Identify
  These will allow you to identify unknown items that you may find!


Medium level character (up to 25)
---------------------------------
+ Some Flasks of Oil. Replace rations of food with "Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger"
  These will always fully satisfy your hunger and they are not eaten by rot
  jellys ;) Lembas (elvish waybread) are also nice but very rare.
+ Many Potions of Cure Critical Wounds, maybe some Potions of Healing.
+ Some Potions of Berserk Strength (mainly for fighter classes)
  These potions work similar to heroism, they rise your damage output instead
  of your hit chance, allowing you to deal very extreme damage. Unfortunately
  they are quite rare. If they are used together with potions of speed the
  result can be devastating.
+ Several Scrolls of Word of Recall
+ Several scrolls of Identify
  Since you will encounter the more nice (or more dangerous..) loot the deeper
  you descend, you will need a bunch of identification scrolls to find out
  what is worth being kept and which items should be thrown away.
+ A potion of Restore Life Levels. It can be very annoying if a monster drains
  your experience (its colour will turn from light green to yellow to indicate
  that it's been drained) and all the monsters you subsequently kill yield
  almost nothing in experience since it's all pouring into refilling the
  drained amount. These potions instantly restore all drained experience!
  (Note that scrolls of Life also restore experience, same as this potion.)
  Most monsters that drain experience are undead and the first ones you will
  probably encounter are liches and vampires. Bloodletter demons drain too.
  A notable low-level monster is the grape jelly. But then again you shouldn't
  fight stationary melee-specialist monsters in melee in the first place..
+ Some Potions of Speed
  These will temporatily boost your global speed (movement/attack/cast) by
  +10. In case you are moving at normal speed this means that your speed is
  doubled, effectively doubling your combat power as well since you can shoot
  and hit twice as fast now. These potions also allow to quickly retreat...
+ a Staff of Teleportation
  This neat baby is your ticket out of most hazard situations where Phase Door
  wouldn't help at all. However keep in mind that staves can be destroyed. So
  if you consider a situation very dangerous and your staff of teleportation
  is suddenly burned to ashes, you should think about reading Word of Recall!
  Unfortunately staves of teleportation are very expensive. Staves can be
  used even while blind or confused!
  It's not a good idea to use staves if your character isn't quite good at
  'Magic Device', press 'C' to check your character screen.
  It's a good idea to try the staff a few times in town before relying on it.
  If needed you could increase your 'Magic Device' skill, see (6.2).
+ You should have found some "Rods of Trap location"
  Keep 2 or 3 of those with you. If you encounter a pit or vault you can
  easily detect all the nasty traps inside. Rods of Door/Stair Location can
  also be helpful.
+ Especially for clearing vaults you might find a staff of light, a wand of
  trap/door destruction and maybe a wand of teleport other useful. However,
  that would be 3 more inventory slots less to pick up loot :)
+ Potions of curing insanity (all types). If you find these, pick them up and
  store them in your house! If you encounter a sanity-blasting monster you will
  want to have these to restore your sanity after the fight.


Higher characters (up to 35)
----------------------------
(If you came this far, good work!)
+ Some Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger or some Lembas if you can find enough. Some
  flasks of oil if your light source needs those.
+ Lots of Potions of Cure Critical Wounds (20..40 for example), if possible
  Potions of Healing instead of cure crits.
+ Some Potions of Berserk Strength (mainly for fighter classes)
+ Several Scrolls of Phase Door
+ Some potions of Restore Life Levels, probably, depending on how often you
  get annoyed by experience drain. If you're fighting a lot of undead, for
  example in the "Paths of the Dead" dungeon, you probably want a bunch of
  these potions.
+ a Rod of Recall
  A rod cannot be destroyed by fire or acid, and you won't have to buy new
  scrolls of WOR since the rod never runs out.
  A rod of recall is especially useful to travel between towns, so you won't
  burn through a lot of scrolls just for visiting all the town stores.
+ Lots of Scrolls of Identify (up to 99!). If you're great at handling magic
  devices, maybe get a Rod of Perception. It does the same thing as a scroll of
  Identify, but you might want one 'of charging' or 'of the istari'.
+ Several Potions of Speed
+ Some Potions of Resistance, since they stack with resistance from items.
  Always quaff these when fighting dragons, demons or hounds.
+ Potions of Healing
  These potions heal you way more than pots of cure critical wounds. However,
  they are more expensive.
+ Maybe rods for support: Trap location, disarming, detection.
+ Some Scrolls of Teleportation.
+ a "Sprig of Athelas"
  This one cures "Black Breath", which you can get infected with if you fight a
  Nazgul (ring wraith)! Normal high undead monsters have a very slim chance too
  to give you Black Breath.
  You can leave the sprig in your house since Black Breath saps your soul very
  slowly, so there should be enough time to finish business in the dungeon and
  recall to town afterwards to eat a sprig. (See (1.3a) for more information
  about Black Breath.)
+ Scrolls of *Remove Curse*. These are expensive in the black market, but are
  sometimes sold in the temple cheaply, so always check the temple when you
  come by. You will want these for getting rid of heavily cursed items, such as
  Nazgul rings of power that you don't use.
+ Potions of curing insanity. If you find these, pick them up and store them in
  your house! If you encounter a sanity-blasting monster you will want to have
  these to restore your sanity after the fight.


Very high characters (36 and above)
-----------------------------------
+ Satisfy Hunger scrolls or Lembas
+ Potions of Healing
+ Potions of Speed, if you don't have magic providing this
+ Potions of Resistance, if you don't have magic providing this
+ Scrolls of Teleportation
+ a Rod of Recall (mainly for travelling between towns).
+ Support rods, such as Trap Location, Detection or Disarming (especially
  useful for clearing vaults).
+ Sprigs of Athelas, scrolls of *Remove Curse*, potions for curing insanity
  (these supplies can be stored in your house, no need to carry them with you).



(7.2) Preparing the equipment for diving into the dungeon
---------------------------------------------------------
Depending on your character level you will need to equip certain items before
entering the dungeon. Here are some guidelines for your equipment:


Beginners (level 1)
-------------------
+ Lantern
  because it provides light within a radius of 2 fields instead of 1 field of
  a torch.
+ A ranged weapon as soon as possible (a boomerang if you use martial arts).
  Don't forget the ammunition ;)
  Try to get a sling or even better a long bow as soon as possible,
  especially if you are weak at hand-to-hand combat.
  At the beginning a ranged weapon can make all the difference and help you to
  proceed quickly. Enchant the bow to (+hit,+dam) where +dam helps a lot to
  increase the total damage you inflict on enemies, since it's multiplied by
  the bow's power factor.
  Note that martial arts users can only use boomerangs, other ranged weapons
  will nullify their Martial Arts skills.
+ An appropriate melee weapon (except if using martial arts, eg Druids!)
  Check out how many blows per round you get with a light dagger, whip,
  cleaver or spear, depending on your favourite weapon class. If you get more
  bpr than with your starter weapon, switch!
  If your character has only one blow per round even with light weapons, choose
  a heavy weapon that can deal more damage in one blow. If your character is
  low on strength, pay attention that you don't buy a weapon that is too heavy
  to use at all. You can press 'x' in shops to examine weapons (and all other
  items), to check if you can benefit from buying it or not.
  If you have only 1 bpr, make sure to dual-wield if your character can do that
  because that will give you a bonus bpr. Don't forget that you cannot dual-
  wield with heavy armour. Rogues should always be dual-wielding.


Low level character (up to 15)
------------------------------
+ Enchant the damage of your melee and/or ranged weapon a bit using "Scrolls
  of Enchant Weapon To-Dam"
+ Get some armor. Note that certain armor can decrease your dexterity or
  spellcasting abilities, partially because it is too heavy. Also some weapons
  will become less powerful if used together with a shield, and some weapons
  cannot be used at all in conjunction with a shield. A fighter should have
  approx. 30..45 AC or more.
  Before buying a piece of armour in a shop, press 'x' to examine it. This will
  tell you if you'd get encumbered wearing it.
+ Buy a fire resistance ring as soon as possible because many monsters can use
  fire spells early on. Also get an acid resistance amulet maybe, since acid
  damage is especially nasty to your inventory and equipment.
  If you're an Ent, early on fire resistance is absolutely mandatory.


Medium level character (up to 25)
---------------------------------
+ Enchant your melee and ranged weapons to at least +8 to damage! Best would
  be (+9,+9) or maybe even (+10,+10). Going over +10 is not feasible with
  normal enchant scrolls, you can use *enchant* scrolls later on.
  You could also ask a high level character if he/she helps you by taking your
  weapons, armour and ammunition to one of the shops that offer an enchantment
  service. Those shops can enchant the items quite high, depending on the level
  of the customer. It's costly though..
  Don't sell scrolls of *enchant weapon* or *enchant armour* if you find those,
  but use them to enchant your items above +9 and up to +15!
+ A fighter should have approx. 40..70 AC or more.
+ Get "Fear Resistance" also know as "Boldness".
+ Get Free Action. You should have this before going much deeper than 1000 ft.
  It prevents you from being paralyzed by traps or monsters.
+ Get the 4 basic resistances, which are: Lightning/Electricity, Acid,
  Frost/Cold, Fire/Heat.
+ Consider buying a small house to store backup equipment or special items
  instead of carrying them around with you.
+ If you manage to find an item that lets you telepathically sense trolls, keep
  it. Use it to locate troll pits, those tend to give a lot of experience!
  Typical items that provide troll-ESP are dwarven helmets or weapons of
  *slay troll*. (ESP = extra sensory perception, ie the ability to sense a
  presence telepathically without a direct line of sight).


Higher characters (up to 35)
----------------------------
+ A fighter should have approx. 65..100 AC or more.
+ Try to get a lantern of Brightness or even *Brightness*, a Dwarven Lantern
  or a Feanorian Lamp. These provide more light and/or don't need to be fueled
  and cannot be extinguished. They may also have some special abilities like
  preventing you from getting overwhelmed by fear!
+ Get "See Invisible" if possible. Some very nasty monsters are invisible and
  "cold-blooded", that means they cannot be seen by infra-vision.
+ Get Poison Resistance! For example Boots of Mirkwood provide poison
  resistance. Also Elven armour often provide it. If you are trained in the
  art of mimicry, you could try to use the form of a monster which has poison
  resistance intrinsically. Drolems and other monsters might insta-kill you
  without poison resistance.
  Elven armour also provides base resistance and has a chance to provide an
  additional 'high' resistance, so it's really useful to get your resistances
  covered. Elven armour is not that expensive and not that rare. If you can't
  find any, ask other players or check the player stores (there tend to be a
  lot of player stores around the town of Gondolin) for offers!
+ Try to Get Confusion Resistance, so you can always read teleport scrolls!
  Note that chaos resistance also provides confusion resistance.
+ Get Nexus Resistance. Nexus attacks can scramble your body, swapping your
  stats, which can mess up your character. (See (5.6).)
+ Try to get Blindness Resistance, so you can always read teleport scrolls!
  Helmets or Caps of seeing give this!
+ Before venturing into Mordor you should have basic (fire/cold/lightning/acid)
  and poison resistance and 'free action' (paralysis resistance).
  Confusion resistance and nexus resistance are a plus.
+ Try to get Hold Life.
  This prevents your life force from being drained, making you lose experience
  and going back in character level. Cloaks of Teleri Hold Life and provide
  Free Action too.
+ Try to get items that provide ESP (extra sensory perception). ESP is a
  telepathic power that allows you to sense monsters even though they aren't
  in your line of sight! This is tremendously useful as you know what monsters
  are lurking on the map and where, so you won't run into nasty surprises.
  Typical item that provide ESP are:
  Crowns of telepathy (full ESP!)
  Weapons of *slay evil* (ESP evil), Weapons of Aman (ESP evil), Weapons of
  Gondolin (ESP evil).


Very high characters (36 and above)
-----------------------------------
+ A fighter should have at least 90 AC. He might also have already AC as hhigh
  as about 130 at level 36 if he is lucky.
+ Get as many high resistances as you can.. You will want Nether, Nexus,
  Disenchantment, Chaos, Sound for example. Note that Saruman and many high
  undead monsters (L and W) have disenchanting melee attacks that waste your
  equipment pretty badly if you don't resist disenchantment.
  Sound resistance will prevent stun effects, which if they accumulate can even
  knock you out completely, leaving you unable to do anything at all!
  Also, your damage and spell casting chance are reduced while stunned.
  Notorious for k.o. are Water Hounds, Impact Hounds, to some extent Gravity
  Hounds, and *especially* Plasma Hounds.
  Note that "Feather Falling" provides resistance to gravity damage.
  ('Levitation' automatically includes feather falling, by the way.)
  Nether and Chaos drain your experience if not resisted (can be cured with a
  potion of restore life levels or according magic). The great thing about
  chaos resistance is that it includes confusion resistance! So if you were
  wearing a ring of confusion resistance, just replace it with a ring of chaos
  resistance and you are set.
+ Get "See Invisible", various nasty monsters are invisible.
+ Get items that sustain your stats, for example a Robe of Permanence if you
  wear light armour, or a kolla (it's a cloak) if you're a fighter class.
+ Get full ESP: Crowns of telepathy typically provide these.
  Some classes have an ESP spell available so they don't need ESP items.
+ Get Randarts (randomly generated artifacts) or Artifacts (predefined
  artifacts / static artifacts) for melee weapon:
  You will have to fight ring wraiths. Normal weapons, even those from
  Gondolin or the most powerful *Defenders* will quickly shatter if they come
  in contact with those corrupted creatures of terror and hate.
  Your only way to fight them is to equip an artifact since these resist ring
  wraiths greatly - their chance of getting destroyed when striking a Nazgul is
  1 in 1000, compared to a few hits for non-artifact weapons.
  (Note that the 'Stormbringer' counts as an artifact in this regard.)
+ You will want items that permanently increase your speed!
  +10 speed or +20 speed will make you approximately twice or three times as
  fast as you usually are. Note that the curve will become flatter the higher
  your speed is, so at some point, increasing your speed any further might be
  less beneficial to you than boosting your attack speed (items that give extra
  attacks) or your critical hit chance (items that give critical hits).
  Use the target dummy in town to test your actual damage output and compare,
  the /tym (test your might) command may prove useful.



(7.3) Surviving critical situations
-----------------------------------

Not getting into a critical situation:
--------------------------------------
Best thing is to not get into a critical situation at all.
To help you estimate the threat of a particular dungeon floor, there are
'feelings' your character may get when you enter the floor:
When you've spend some time in town or on a dungeon floor, your depth number in
the bottom right corner will turn light-blue. This means that you will get a
special feeling on the next dungeon floor you enter, displayed in yellow.
That feeling will tell you about the threat of that particular floor, so you
may consider leaving it again if it sounds too nasty. See (4.8) for details.


Map structures:
---------------
There are certain situations and constellations that will occur often in a
very similar manner. Here are some of them, together with some advice how
to manage it.

-A pack of approaching monsters (here orcs), often orcs or trolls:

#########   #  #
#  ooooo#   #  #
#  ooooo#####@ # <- stand there to intercept the incoming orcish horde.
#   ooooo oo   #    As soon as three or four of them stand on adjacent fields
#        o     #    move up one field to limit the attackers to 3 at a time.
#############  #    Sometimes the AI is very smart and monsters will try to
            #  #    surround you anyways. Phase door scrolls will help you out
                    then.

-Usually, animal packs will retreat if you chase them in hallways, and will
 only attack if you enter a room or if your hit points are around 50% or worse.
 You might want to just take them out with a bow or another ranged weapon
 instead of chasing them.
 If you decide to chase them to the next room make sure you have enough phase
 door scrolls and healing pots to win a fight where you are attacked from all
 sides at once.
 If you try to chase them through corridors, use the 'Sprint' fighting
 technique in case your character has learned it (see (6.12)).

-If you prefer close combat over ranged and your character can use fighting
 techniques, make sure to use the 'Sprint' or 'Taunt' technique to catch
 annoying monsters like shamans or priests that otherwise try to keep a
 distance.

-The range of your missile weapon (slings, bows, crossbows, boomerangs) is
 often greater than your own range of sight when it comes to dark hallways.
 Just by shooting into the dark you can take out monsters, if you know they're
 there.

-If you open a door, especially doors to pits with unknown content, be very
 careful and open the door diagonally to have as little creatures as possible
 see you from inside the pit. If you open the door to a so-called "jelly pit"
 (contains icky-things, jellies, mold, mushroom patches) you might be
 insta-killed otherwise. Here is how to open the door:

#######
#jm$,m#
#$m,jj#
#ijmm,#
#,mjjj#@ <- stand here and open the door diagonally
#j$m,i+  <- don't stand here or more monsters will see and immediately
#######     target you from inside

Prepare to close the door again as quickly as possible, it might be needed
(or just teleport away). In general you should leave jelly pits alone.
Coin pits (lots of '$' inside) can also contain very powerful mimics!

-If you fight monsters that can cast ball spells or breathe on you, be aware
 that they might target a field adjacent to you and hence still hit you (thanks
 to the radius of the spell around the actually targetted grid) even if they
 cannot target you directly!
 Similar goes for monsters who can cast summoning spells.

-Pack monsters can be very nasty if those farther away from you can still
 shoot or cast spells over the heads of their comrades in the front line, from
 behind, novice paladin packs come to mind at low levels.
 In that case you should make sure that only very few of them can see you at a
 time. If your health suddenly drops, teleport away at once, or at least
 retreat behind a corner.

-Sometimes it might be a good idea to use a "Stone-to-mud" or "Trap/Door
 destruction" spell to open a door from a distance.

-For weaker characters it might be a good idea to stay around 1000..1500 ft
 and try to get enough stat potions (potions that raise your six primary
 stats, STR INT WIS DEX CON CHR) until they have a considerably high amount
 of hit points and/or combat potential before they dive deeper!

-If you fight a monster that is capable of casting powerful summoning spells,
 teleport at once if any summoned monsters appear around you!
 Don't hesitate for a split second, just to "check whether that was actually
 a dangerous summon or whether you might just take on all of them on".
 Hesitating in order to do so may well be your death sentence.


Some monsters that people often get killed by are:
--------------------------------------------------
-At very low levels there are especially 2 death causes:
 a) Pack monsters that have ranged attacks and fire at you all at once. See
    the map structures section above.
 b) Monsters that are simply a little bit faster than you so you can't run
    away if you decide that you can't beat them.
    Don't forget to use your 'Sprint' or 'Flash Bomb' fighting technique if
    you have learned it, might be useful to get away, or even to kill your
    opponents instead.
    See (7.1) and (7.2) how to equip yourself to minimize risks.

-If you recognize that you cannot win a fight and it will likely end deadly
 it might be a good idea to read a scroll of Word of Recall as early as
 possible and then try to survive until it kicks in and carries you to safety.

-Druid monsters, for example druid snotlings or druid kobolds. They can appear
 at very low level and they are able to cast firebolts that insta-kill you
 (instantly kill you).
 Again you should try to utilize fighting techniques if you can.

-Elite Uruks, they fire extremely sharp arrows, always posing a high threat.

-Chieftain/Warrior/Monk/Unbeliever monsters of any kind. You will often see
 someone being killed by a hill troll monk or forest troll chieftain for
 example.. Prepare to hit your phase door macro if you spot a shimmering
 extraordinarily fast moving monster within a potentially dangerous mob.
 Especially dangerous are such ego versions of a base monster type that has
 elementally branded melee attacks. You should quaff a potion of resistance
 when fighting those to reduce the elemental damage part of their melee
 attacks.

-Veteran archer/Master archer monsters of any kind can pose a very high
 threat. Better get reflection ability if you are planning to fight these in
 a ranged duel.

-Hounds with breaths that need a high resistance or that cannot be resisted at
 all. For example..
 At lower levels: Air hounds, Nexus hounds, Vibration hounds, Impact hounds,
                  Inertia hounds, Aquatic & Water hounds (avoid aquatic &
                  water hounds especially; the others still give very good
                  experience at a reasonable danger exposure.)
 At higher levels: Plasma hounds, Gravity hounds, Time hounds, Aether hounds,
                   Hounds of Tindalos (beware of Gravity & Time hounds
                   especially, Aether hounds can also give you some surprise).

-Dark-Elven Warlocks. These belong to the few monsters that can cast mana
 bolts, which inflict very high damage. Even worse, DEW (Dark-Elven Warlocks)
 appear in packs. Beware!

-Will o' the wisps are very hard to spot and catch, their curses are
 devastating.

-The Glass Golem drives everyone insane whom it manages to hit, high AC helps.

-Drolems. A constructed dragon that will breathe poison for high damage and
 takes a lot of hits before ceasing to function.

-The Stormbringer, an animated blade that bears mad wrath within. It swings
 so powerful that it can knockout its enemies with ease. Defeating it,
 however, will make it usable to its defeater!

-Ulik the Troll. He is so strong that his hits cause earthquakes and he cannot
 be stopped by (non-permanent) walls. Beware his prowess in melee combat!
 Also he moves surprisingly swiftly!

-Dracolichs and Spectral Tyrannosaurs. They have high hit points and are able
 to breathe nether, which means their damage will be maxed out.
 A dark/light green blinking D is actually a Death Drake, and although it can
 also breathe nether it is much less dangeours than a Dracolich because of its
 low hit points. Dracolichs and especially Spectral Tyrannosaurs can occur on
 fairly low levels (usually 55 and 46) which makes them a very nasty surprise.

-Wyrms. The base element variations of these (hell, ice, storm, bile and swamp)
 as well as the multi-hued one do look exactly like ancient dragons, but are a
 magnitude stronger. So make sure to 'l'ook at that "dragon" before waking it
 up or it might be too late. In particular you *need* potions of resistance,
 of speed and of healing to take on a wyrm.

The most powerful representant of each class:
-Ranger chieftains are tough opponents who can nail you on the spot and
 use magic attacks as well as summon.
-Knight Templars, powerful paladins who are immune to holy attacks and
 are even able to call an angel for support.
-Patriarchs, these unfaltering priestlords can summon and curse rapidly.
-Master Mindcrafters, their ability to summon mighty support and to smash
 your brain by psi attacks is feared.
-Old sorcerors are able to summon ancient dragonkind and wyrms, beware!
-(Grand) Swordsmasters, most skilled swordsmen that will disarm you easily.
-(Grand) Master mystics, most powerful martial artists. With their special
 moves they can manage to stun you easily. Best remedy is high AC so
 they won't hit you in the first place. Alternatively you can quaff potions
 to remove any stun effect.
-(Grand) Master thieves, very fast and stealthy they steal your possessions!

-Unique enemies. If you see a monster blinking in different colours, before
 trying to kill it you should consult other players or 'l'ook at the monster,
 to find out whether it is an unique monster. If so, then you should examine
 it by pressing  ~ 7  in game to look up its abilities and make sure you are
 prepared to fight him. If possible, consult fellow players for their opinions.
 (You can also check r_info.txt, see (7.4) for more info about spoiler files.)

-If you see an enemy that you don't know anything about and that could pose a
 threat (especially if it's inside a vault!), STAY AWAY and consult either an
 experienced player or look it up by pressing  ~ 7  to find out what the
 opponent is capable of.
 The safest (and most boring and least rewarding) way to play is to avoid
 vaults! Vaults can contain an enemy against whom you don't have the slightest
 chance of winning. Vaults however can also contain great treasure!
 (See (4.6) for more information about vaults.)

-The most powerful monsters of the demon realm, the dragonkind and the
 heavenly planes, namely Star-spawns of Cthulu, Great Wyrms of Power,
 balance keepers of the skies, sun and stars (Blades), Nether Realm guards.

-Blinking 'A' (unique angels) or 'U' (powerful or unique demons) as well as
 bright coloured 'U' (greater demons) and blinking 'W' (zephyr lords or
 Nazgul) always pose a high threat. While Zephyr lords aren't that strong on
 their own they are able to summon packs of hounds which can mean a swift doom
 if those have dangerous breathing attacks.
 Some other dangerous demons are..
 Servitors of the outer gods, Lords of Change, Greater Balrogs,
 Bloodthirsters, Pit Fiends, Great Unclean Ones, Keepers of Secrets.

-High undead can also pose a high threat and are responsible for many a death,
 those are Nightwalkers, Nightcrawlers, Nightwings and their likes.

-Nazgul have quite some chance to destroy your melee weapon if you hit them!
 In case your melee weapon isn't your main way of fighting you could inscribe
 it @Ox before fighting a Nazgul to avoid auto-retaliation and then use
 spells or whatever to destroy it. If you rely on melee weapons get an
 artifact since these resist Nazgul greatly!
 However, you probably still don't want to risk your best artifact weapon,
 so try to get a worse artifact which you can solely (ab)use for fighting
 Nazgul. Some people are rumoured to defeat Nazgul with nothing but their
 ability to read, although they aren't even remotely magically talented..
 (Compare (1.3a).)

-Unique 'P's are often very dangerous, some say the most dangerous next to
 Morgoth himself is Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss.


Mistakes / Carelessness:
------------------------
-Further, players are often killed if they lack resistances and/or free action
 (against paralyzation) but nevertheless dive down into the dungeon very
 quickly.

-Teleport out of trouble
 If you are not an anti-magic-user, you should buy a staff of teleportation as
 soon as possible since it can take you out of dangerous situations.
 However, the staff is no guarantee :)
 After you bought it, try if you can actually use it well or if you keep
 failing! If you're not good at magic devices you might have to spend points
 into your 'Magic Device' skill.
 I recommend to always have at least 3 charges in the staff before diving into
 the dungeon.
 Another possibility is to use a Scroll of Remove Curse (buy it in the temple
 ie the green '4') on a Ring or Amulet of Teleportation. Try to activate one
 of them.

-Quaff potions of cure critical wounds or healing if you get (heavily) stunned
 to prevent a lethal knockout in the next round! Further you can't use martial
 arts special moves while stunned, cutting your damage a lot.
 Get sound resistance to not waste potions to cure stun effects from
 water/sound/gravity/ice/plasma attacks.

-Don't wait till you are a '1' or '0' before you try to teleport out.
 If you want to be on the safe side, teleport out when you are a '4' or '3'.
 Remember that your teleport staff may fail sometimes.

-Before AND after a larger fight, check your inventory if you can carry on
 or if you have to return to town to stock up. A common problem is that some
 monsters can drain charges from or burn up your teleport items, which you
 might overlook.

-If you are surrounded by huge piles of loot from dead monsters you might be
 tempted to drop cheaper items like phase door scrolls to make room for the
 precious loot, and go /afk to wait for pseudo-id. However, know that you
 _can_ all of a sudden be ambushed during that time by enemies. By enemies
 that _require_ you to use phase door..

-I do not recommend to drop food nor oil in exchange for loot if you're not
 planning to recall instantly after you picked up the loot.

-If you team up, make sure that you stick closely together all the time.
 Wandering off usually greatly increases both players' risk of death!

-Learn from your mistakes. If you die, think about if you were taking too high
 a risk, and check if you overlooked anything, maybe you were missing
 essential items (cure critical wound potions to get rid of confusion and
 blindness).
 Next time, be more careful. Playing TomeNET means learning a lot about the
 monsters/items.


Teamplay:
---------
-Team up with fellow players that are approximately at your character level.
 This means more fun and less danger. Your teammates can save your life and
 support you with helpful spells, items and knowledge.
 A player in a party gets a share of experience points from the kills of other
 party members if they are within 7 levels to the player.
 A character cannot gain any exp from a monster which has previously
 encountered a player more than 8 levels higher than this character himself.
 (So there is 1 level tolerance towards sharing experience.)
 For winners (queens/kings/empresses/emperors) the range in which they share
 experience is as far as 11 levels.
 Winners don't share experience with non-winner characters.
 If a party member gets reduced experience because his level is too high
 for the dungeon floor, this penalty will affect all of his team mates on this
 floor too, even if their level is lower. This means the party should always
 dive at the optimum depth for its highest member.
 See (6.9) for details about partying!

-Good combinations are the classical meat shields / damage dealers /
 supporters. Mages usually make a great team with whomever they team up.
 Keep your teammates in mind and don't teleport out if it meant
 certain death to them while you could still take some hits.

-Make sure you stick together with your team mates. If you wander off instead
 of staying close you will greatly increase your risk of dying to something.


Manage your spells and items:
-----------------------------
It can happen often that you die in a specific situation that you could have
survived had you actually used everything at your disposal, that you forgot
about, either because..
-you panicked or because
-you expected a new, strong opponent to perform just as weakly as the other
 hundred monsters you slew before even though it gives away that it is special
 by its blinking colour or by being represented by a symbol/letter that you are
 not familiar with and haven't seen before in that dungeon.

Some examples:
-Forgetting to apply a buff, such as a berserk strength potion or resist heat
 against strong fire breathers (which are one of the early threats in the game)
-Neglecting to use a protective/defensive spell before engaging in a fight
-Not casting 'damage-add' spells, ie spells that don't deal high damage but
 that deal _additional_ damage to your main damage spells, which is a welcome
 bonus that can make a difference. Examples are mainly storm-type spells but
 can also be cloud spells, ie all spells that continue to deal damage over time
 after being initially cast, allowing you to cast direct damage spells in
 addition to them being active, increasing your total overall damage output.
-Not using items because you weren't aware of their beneficial uses. Such as
 throwing a potion of salt water at a pack of monsters that is trying to
 surround you, to temporarily blind them (which has the same result as applying
 confusion state to them), allowing you to either escape or kill them while
 they're groping around blindly, even though it only lasts for a moment.



(7.4) Spoiler files
-------------------
In the folder tomenet/lib/game you find several data files containing
various information about all monsters, items and other features of TomeNET.
These files are named X_info.txt and can be read via a normal text editor.
The most important files are:
a_info.txt  contains all artifacts.
            (You can also access this information in-game by pressing ~6 .)
r_info.txt  contains all monsters.
            (You can also access this information in-game by pressing ~7 .)
k_info.txt  contains all base item types.
e_info.txt  contains all ego item types.
All files contain a block of information, either at the beginning or at the
very end, which explains the meaning of each discrete info-line.



(7.5) Monster tactics
---------------------
Monsters may follow certain schemes regarding their movement, target selection
and spell-casting.

Movement:
---------
Rather mindless monsters might just try to get to the player straight away
while more clever monsters might try to avoid being kited, depending on their
hit points or if there are buddies around. Also, some pack animals might avoid
to encounter you in hallways but jump you all at once when you enter a room or
when your hit points drop to around 50% or worse.

Target selection:
-----------------
When a monster has multiple players next to it it might choose its target
depending on its cleverness, power and health state. For example it might go
for the target it perceives as most squishy.
Players may counter this by using techniques such as Taunt or Distract.

Spell-casting:
--------------
Despite appearing random sometimes monsters prefer certain spells over others.
If a player is close a monster might especially try to blink away to continue
to throw attack or summon spells at the player from afar.
If a monster is low on HP or scared it might try to use escape spells and if
it's low on HP or stunned it might emphasize heal spells (the chance to
successfully cast those is also negatively affected by stun same as all other
spells - compare (4.12)).



(7.6) Town/dungeon related hints
--------------------------------
-Before going as deep as 1000 ft (ie dungeon level 20) or deeper, make sure
 that you have 'free action' because many monsters will be able to try and
 paralyze you.

-For Mordor make sure you have the four base resistances and also free action.
 You might also want to get nexus resistance as soon as possible because nexus
 attacks can swap your six character attributes randomly.

-For Paths of the Dead you should also have nether resistance and 'hold life'
 because many undead monsters have nether-based attacks or can drain your
 experience points.

-When going even deeper the next resistance you want is probably chaos, since
 it can deal excessive damage and potentially deadly side effects (experience
 drain, hallucination and confusion) all at once. After that maybe comes
 disenchantment resistance to protect your equipment, or sound resistance to
 avoid getting knocked out by certain attacks such as sound, and especially
 water and plasma (hound packs of those types can knock you out quickly).

-In Gondolin mindcrafters and archers may spawn. You should enter the local
 inn if you want to go AFK so you don't get killed by their ranged attacks.

-Minas Anor, Lothlorien and especially Khazad-dum can spawn swordmasters or
 even grand swordmasters, which can disarm you and deal heavy damage. Beware.

-Before challenging a dungeon boss, look it up in the monster lore (press ~7)
 because dungeon bosses sometimes have extraordinary abilities or stats that
 you want to be aware of. They do give extraordinary amounts of experience
 points and sometimes special item drops too.



(8) Miscellanous
================

(8.1) 'The Art Not To Die'
--------------------------
You died. Hm, very annoying indeed. If you are a "No-ghost" or "Hellish"
character, then you are wiped out now. Otherwise you became a ghost on the
same dungeon level as you died on. Your items are scattered on the floor, now
what to do? The items will disappear forever if you leave that dungeon level
and noone remains down there to "keep the level static" or "hold the level",
as the technical terms are. If you think you really need the items, ask
someone to get down to your dungeon level and either revive you there using a
'Scroll of Life' or pick up your items and give them back to you in town after
you revived in the town's temple (green '4').
If your character level is still very low, you can just decide to suicide and
start over. That is sometimes easier.
In TomeNET you will often encounter new situations that can lead to death. The
most important thing here is that you keep in mind your mistakes of the past
to prevent them from happening again. A key to winning is a firm knowledge of
the monsters that you encounter, so you will be able to decide if you should
attack or flee.
In my opinion playing TomeNET can be called "the art not to die".

Notes:
 - As an everlasting character you can somewhat cheat death by activating
   "Instant Resurrection" in any temple, see (4.5a) for details and drawbacks.
 - You can use the  /page  command to get someone's attention if he seems afk
   and you need his help. This command will make his game client beep 3 times.



(8.2) Character Dumps
---------------------
You should send in character dumps, if you have reached an intermediate level,
to http://angband.oook.cz/ or if it died an interesting death or if something
unusual happened to your character, or if you just want to show off your
special way of distributing skill points. Character dumps are always nice to
view. :)

You can create a character dump by invoking the character screen by pressing
'C' and then pressing 'f' (as it states at the bottom).

Character dumps are automatically created in your /TomeNET/lib/user folder
if your character dies. The filename is charactername-death.txt, for example
Gandalf-death.txt. (no overwrite-check is performed.)

Clients of version greater than plain 4.4.2 will also generate an automatic
dump when you win the game by defeating Morgoth. Following above's example,
it will be named Gandalf-victory.txt accordingly.

Also, newer clients will automatically take an xhtml screenshot too when a
char dump is made, of same name but with .xhtml ending. Those can be viewed
in most webbrowsers.



(8.3) Golem creation
---------------------
Players can create golems, mindless animated humanoids that will fight for
them. As long as the golem is not in their way of moving, monsters won't
attack golems, but instead the controlling player.

Although golems can kill monsters, you don't get credit for it and they are
more of a fun feature than a serious enhancement to your character, so don't
be too hell-bent on creating a golem or you will be disappointed.

To create a golem, you will need these parts:
-A 'scroll of Golem Creation'
-A massive piece of a specific material
-Arms, up to 4. (Arms are optional, but without arms it cannot attack!)
-Legs, must be exactly 2.
-Command scrolls (see below). If a command scroll is not in your inventory when
 you create the golem, it will not understand that command later on even if you
 acquire that type of scroll afterwards! So make sure you carry all 3 command
 scrolls before creating it.
 (Command scrolls are not consumed upon golem creation.)

After the golem has been created it will start out passively, not following any
particular command. It will just sit there doing nothing. To actually control
it and make it do something you will need 3 command scrolls. These aren't read
but activated, meaning you don't use 'r' key but 'Shift+a' to toggle them.
On activation they toggle the golem's behaviour. They are infinitely reusable.
If you toggle a scroll a second time, the golem will return to sitting around
idly, doing nothing.
The scrolls are:

-A 'Golem Scroll of Attack'
 When activated, the golem will move towards your current target (provided it
 is actually hostile) to attack it.
-A 'Golem Scroll of Guard'
 When activated, the golem will automatically attack any hostile creature
 that moves up next to it.
-A 'Golem Scroll of Following'
 When activated, the golem will follow you around as long as it has nothing
 else to do (no guard/attack command being executed), see below:

These three command stack. For example you can activate both 'attack' and
'following' command, in which case the golem will follow you around, but as
soon as you target any hostile creature it will go to attack it!

If you have gathered all these items in your inventory, read the scroll of
golem creation!

Each arm will inflict (x)d(arm value) damage on a target.
The arm value is displayed in brackets, part of the item name.
The 'x' are listed in the materials table below.
Example: A 'Golem Arm (+8)' of an 'Iron Golem' will do 6d8 damage which means
that each hit will inflict between 6 and 48 damage (27 on average).
Each leg will increase the golem's speed by the number displayed on the leg.

The material determines armour class, hit points and the damage dice count of
the golem. Materials are:
    Wood             20 AC,  10d10 hit dice,  2 damage dice.
    Copper           40 AC,  10d20 hit dice,  4 damage dice.
    Iron             70 AC,  10d40 hit dice,  6 damage dice.
    Aluminium        90 AC,  10d60 hit dice,  8 damage dice.
    Silver          100 AC,  10d70 hit dice, 10 damage dice.
    Gold            130 AC,  10d80 hit dice, 12 damage dice.
    Mithril         160 AC, 10d100 hit dice, 14 damage dice.
    Adamantite      210 AC, 10d150 hit dice, 16 damage dice.
Some rumours say that the highest materials can only be found on even deeper
dungeons than where Morgoth, Lord of Darkness resides.

If the creator inscribes items in his inventory with '@G' and then creates a
golem, those items will be transferred to the golem (careful, they cannot be
retrieved!) and fuse with it, bestowing it with their abilities.
The following rules are applied:
-An item 'of life (+x)' increases the hit dice number by x, by up to +3 in
 total (so the golem gets 13dXXX hit points).
-An item that improves the player's tunneling ability bestows the KILL_WALL
 ability upon the golem.
-An item that gives fire or acid resistance will make the golem immune(!) to
 fire or acid.
-An item that gives nether or nexus or disenchantment resistance will give
 the according resistance to the golem.
-Appropriate runes can be used for the resistances/immunities listed above,
 which may be cheaper than using items.
All other items/abilities have no effect.

Golems can't be detected by ESP, they regenerate quickly, they are powerful
and can push past weaker monsters, they can bash doors. They can dig through
rock, they are immune to cold, electricity and poison, they don't know fear
and can neither be confused nor paralyzed. They are immune to teleportation
attacks. Golems have always the maximum possible hit dice. Further, golems
count as '100 %clones', hence giving no experience, items or form credit (for
mimicry users) if someone kills them.
Golems always attack by hitting with their arms for raw physical damage.
A golem has the same level as its owner had at the time of creation.
Golem owners don't get experience for monsters killed by the golem.

*If the scroll of attack is toggled, the golem will attack its master's current
 target.
*If the scroll of guard is toggled, the golem will start attacking monsters
 nearby. If there aren't any, it just waits.
*If the scroll of following is toggled, the golem will just follow its master.
 If a scroll is activated although the according state is already active, the
 golem will stop doing that.

Last but not least, the golem is..
-following you on staircases up/downwards.
-transported with you by word of recall.
-not transported by normal teleportation.
-saved if you exit the game.
-the golem will never attack other players unless you set them to hostile via
 the party menu ('P'). If they are hostile, the same rules as for monsters
 apply (see the description of the 3 command scrolls above).
-never attacked in melee by other players except if hostile.
 Spells cast by other players will always hurt it though.



(8.4) Artifact creation
-----------------------
(Also see (5.9b) for details about artifacts in general.)
"Scrolls of Artifact Creation" count to the most wanted items in the game
because of their power to turn a normal piece of equipment into a powerful
random artifact. Often kings and queens look out for these since they are
unable to use static artifacts, so they depend on rand-arts.
The scrolls are very rarely found; occasions to buy one are fair in the
expensive black market, but also the normal BM may sometimes offer some.

It doesn't matter where you are, what level you are, or whether your character
has 'luck' or not when you read the scroll, the resulting artifact's power is
always determined randomly and cannot be influenced by the player,
except for hit point bonus available for characters that have 'winner' status
(defeated Morgoth), which can be suppressed by inscribing the artifact creation
scroll '!L' (also see 'type-dependant mods' list further below).

Note that randarts created by scrolls of artifact creation do not differ in any
way from randarts that are found instead of created. (With the only difference
that scrolls offer you the '!L' option.) The artifacts' power, price, stats,
abilities and curses are generated exactly the same way, by the same program
code, using the same probabilities.


Here is some advice how to use these most valuable scrolls wisely:

DOESN'T ENCHANT WHOLE STACKS:

-Don't use scrolls of artifact creation on item stacks, it would
reduce the stack to 1.

ONLY WORKS ON STANDARD EQUIPMENT:

-Artifact creation only works on items that can be equipped - with the
exception of tool items like diggers, picklock, money belt, device of theft
prevention, tarpaulin, flint, mummy wrapping, climbing set. These won't work!
Also, it does not work on rings of polymorphing or amulets of telepathy!

DOESN'T WORK ON EGOS / ARTS:

-Don't use them on ego items or artifacts, or you will lose the scroll!

 Watch out: 'Indestructible' and 'Cursed' rings are ego items too, so are
 'Amulets of Telepathy' and Dragon Scale Mails 'of Defense', so you cannot
 art these!
 Also you cannot art 'Rings of Polymorphing'!

-Ammo that is '(exploding)' is actually not an ego item! Contrary to intuition,
 it is technically just a pval. This means that you can artify basic ammo that
 is '(exploding)'.
 Note that using exploding ammo instead of non-exploding ammo for artifact
 creation does not affect whether or not the resulting randart will actually be
 exploding or not, so it does not matter.

THE BASE ITEM MATTERS, ENCHANTMENTS DO NOT (except for jewelry, see below):

-You will want to use the cheapest base item version you can find, because
it will get rerolled randomly anyway. This means that you can even use cursed
items, it doesn't matter (just make sure it's not a ring named 'A Cursed Ring
of...' because that kind of curse is an ego-power!).
For example there is no difference between "arting" a ring of extra attacks
(+3) and a ring of extra attacks (-1) {cursed}. In fact, you should art the
cursed one, because you can still get money out of the (+3) one by selling it
to a store.
However, jewelry that has +hit, +dam or +AC mods is a special case, read on:

HOW IT WORKS ON JEWELRY:

-In general, it's not a good idea to try to turn a ring or amulet that
has high bonus numbers into an artifact, like for example a ring of speed
(+11) because these numbers will get erased and randomly re-rolled. Your great
speed ring will not get more than +7 speed as a randart, much likely less, so
speed rings in particular are very poor targets for artifact creation.
So if you want to use the scroll on say a ring of extra attacks, you should
actually use the cheapest one you can find, like (+1), or even a cursed one.
It doesn't matter, because it will get rerolled randomly anyway, and your
cursed version could just as likely end up as an awesome (+3) high end randart
ring of extra attacks.
However... read on:

-On jewelry (+to-hit,+to-dam) and [+AC] will stay the same, for example a ring
of slaying (+10,+15) will keep the (+10,+15) and an Amulet of Reflection [+11]
will keep the [+11] to AC when turned into a randart.
(Any dice (xdy) as well as _base_ AC [x,+0] on jewelry will always become 0,
but there is currently no jewelry in the game that has damage dice or base AC.)

-When arting jewelry, keep in mind that it does NOT work on
amulets of telepathy, rings of polymorphing or on rings that are named
'a Cursed Ring of..' (because that's not a normal curse but an ego-power)!

HOW IT WORKS ON NON-JEWELRY:

-All boni, to-hit/to-dam/to-ac and the pval/bpval (those (+x) bonus) are
randomly rerolled. So it won't matter what stats the item has, only its
base type is important.

ITEMS THAT ALREADY HAVE ONE OR MORE ABILITIES:

-Some items already possess certain abilities even without ego powers.
For example dragon scale mails or jewelry. Important: The abilities of these
items will be added to the randart abilities when it comes to determining the
total power of that random artifact. That means that you're less likely to see
many additonal abilities on an item which already has several abilities in
it's basic form.
For example it's hard to get extra mods on a Multi-hued Dragon Scale Mail, and
in fact impossible to get any extra mod on a Power Dragon Scale Mail, so don't
waste a scroll on this one.

-However, IGNORE_ flags on items are an exception and do not count into this.
Also, when selecting randart mods, the game will not check if that mod already
existed on the base item (example: 'everburning' mod being added to a feanorian
lamp, which already has that by default ie needs no fuel), so if unlucky it
might seem as if an item did not gain any mods, but in fact it just did not
gain any NEW mods it didn't already possess.

-'Activation' does not tax the base power either. It's a free property same as
ignore-flags mentioned above. (Prominent example: Dragon scale mails.)

-Note that any mod the base item type already possesses will definitely also be
in the final randart.
Examples: Shadow Blades and Witan Boots will modify stealth, Demon Hammers
will always have SLAY_DEMON mod.
However, there are certain exceptions:
1) if an item gains AGGRAVATE flag in the artifying process, it will lose any
   stealth or invisibility. This allows more than +5 speed on Witan Boots for
   example.
2) Slay flags can be upgraded to kill flags. So a Demon Hammer will lose its
   granted SLAY_DEMON flag if it gets KILL_DEMON instead.
3) -Resistances can be upgraded to immunities. So a Serpent Scale Mail will
    lose its acid resistance if it gets acid immunity.
   -Confusion resistance is overwritten by chaos resistance.
4) Minor ESP base flags can be removed from the item in these ways:
   -Dragons replaces Dragonriders
   -Evil replaces Orc/Troll/Giant/Undead/Demon
   -Full ESP removes all other ESP flags
5) If the item ends up cursed, certain granted base flags can be removed too:
   -Curse removes blessing
   -Experience drain removes hold-life
   -attribute mali remove the according sustenance (STR/INT/WIS/DEX/CON/CHR)

MULTI-HUED DRAGON SCALE MAIL IMMUNITIES:

-As a specialty, the immunities on MHDSM are actually *retained*! They are not
rerolled randomly but survive the artifying process. So you can pick a MHDSM
with two immunities of your choice and attempt to use an artifact creation
scroll on it to make it acquire additional powers (it cannot gain any further
immunities though, since 2 are the maximum for any type of item).
Note that MHDSM are poor targets for artifact creation though, because their
immunities and resistances already account for a high amount of 'item power',
meaning that it will be very hard to get good additional powers on them from
the artifact creation process.

POWER DRAGON SCALE MAIL:

As mentioned above, it is impossible to gain any additional powers on PDSM, so
don't waste your artifact creation scroll on it!

DISCOUNTED ITEMS:

-Items will lose any discount tag when they are artified.


Also note that randarts cannot get more than two immunities in total.


Mods on the final randart:
--------------------------
The item will gain a random number of random properties. The more powerful it
becomes, the higher a chance of also becoming 'aggravating' will be.
(See (5.8) for more information about AGGRAVATE flag.)

There is always a 10% chance that the resulting randart will be 'cursed'.
Cursed randarts cannot be sold to shops even if the curse is broken. They gain
only very few abilities, which are accompanied by different types of curses.

All armour-type randarts will have at least +10 to AC bonus (except if they
happen to be cursed), usually much more, dragon scale mails especially.
Also, the higher level the base type of an armour, the more +AC it can expect
as a randart, because armour gets baselevel/15 added to its AC.
Base item types that come with +AC (Mithril Helmet always comes with +10 AC
pre-enchanted for example, see k_info.txt) get half of that added to their AC
too. These +AC boni from base item level and base item pre-enchantment do not
factor into the artifact's power, ie they do not "count" in the flag cost
calculation, except when the +AC exceeds +30, which is always costly.
So basically for armour, you want to use the base item type with the highest
pre-enchantment and with the highest base level. Usually you won't need to pay
attention to this though, because the higher level items are automatically the
better items anyway and hence you will pick them without much thinking. :-p

The base Item's weight, price or rarity (not to be confused with the item's
base level, which however only matters for armour pieces as explained above)
do not have any influence on the randart creation process.

Possible mods that randarts may get depend on its base type.
Further, there are general mods that may appear on all items regardless of its
type. For each applied mod there is a chance of 50% to be picked from either
type-dependant mods or general mods.
- Ammunition (shots/pebbles, arrows, bolts) will never get general mods but
  only type-dependant ones.
- Boomerangs, bows, crossbows and slings will somewhat less often receive
  type-dependant mods than general mods.
- Dragon Scale Mails will more often receive type-dependant mods than general
  mods.
All types not listed under 'Type-dependant mods' will only gain general mods
(for example all jewelry, ie rings and amulets).

Last but not least certain mods will limit or even cancel certain other mods,
sometimes following general rules, sometimes item-type specific rules:

For example an item that provides critical strike and strength bonus might at
first randomly obtain a +8 bonus for its critical strike mod, but then the
strength mod will cut down the final randart bonus to a +5, because items
aren't allowed to give more than +5 to any character stat (str, int, etc).

Similarly, stealth is limited to +5 on most items except for cloaks, so you
cannot get Witan Boots that give more than +5 to speed, since they also always
modify stealth (because the base item type modifies stealth), and stealth is
capped at +5. (Exception: If they get aggravation flag.)

On boots, +speed mod takes precedence over most other limiting mods, which
means that speed-limiting mods will be erased from the boots in most cases if
they threaten to cut down the final pval. Note that mods provided by the base
item type can never be removed, so the stealth mod will never be removed from
Witan Boots and therefore always limit their speed to the stealth cap of +5.

(*): This mod (+LIFE) may only spawn on a randart (no matter how it is created,
     be it via scroll or via killing of monsters) if either
     a) the player is a winner (Queen/King/Empress/Emperor) or
     b) the server has the 'Fallen Kings Etiquette' enabled, meaning that
        players who won once but then died cannot use static artifacts either
        (press '~' followed by 'd' to check the server settings), and the
        player is actually a fallen winner who lost his title due to death,
        AND his level is at least 50.
     If a player actually wears/wields a +LIFE randart, the +LIFE mod will only
     have an effect on winners (Queens/Kings/Empresses/Emperors).

     If you don't want to create a randart that has a chance for +LIFE, you can
     inscribe your scroll of artifact creation:  !L


General mods:

Technical internals
-------------------
More details about how randart creation works internally:
First, a 'target power' is chosen randomly, usually in the range from 40..120.
Then, TomeNET tries several times to generate a randart that approximately
fits into that target power. To do this, after a randart is randomly created,
all its abilities are checked and calculated into a single number, the
'artifact_power'. If this approximately matches the 'target power', the
randart is finally created. If the numbers differ a lot, the randart is erased
and randomly recreated until its powers are fitting. The higher the target
power is, the more likely the randart will be 'aggravating nearby creatures'.
(See (5.8) for more information about AGGRAVATE flag.)



(8.5) Reward item creation
--------------------------
PvP-mode characters may obtain item rewards by killing a lot of opponents (see
(6.13) for details on PvP mode), and events such as Highlander Tournament and
Dungeon Keeper will give parchments to the winners that can be turned in at the
mayor's office for reward items.

Reward items are different from all other items (those obtained from
extermination orders, monsters, chests, acquirement scrolls or even
artifact creation scrolls) in the way that they are specifically tailored
to fit your character relatively well.
There is still some randomness playing a part in it though, so the outcome will
always vary and not necessarily be exactly what you wished for.

Since the resulting item will be affected by your character and skill chart,
what you must actively do BEFORE turning in a deed for a reward item is:

- spend skill points! Never get a reward item without having spent any skill
  points. Make sure that you have at least 3.000 in your vital skill(s) so the
  reward-creating algorithm notices it.
  If you have increased your 'Magic' skill even just a little bit (note that
  increasing Mimicry will also increase Magic skill slightly!) you will have a
  chance to receive caster items (eg some hat of intelligence).
  Especially important: Magic skills, weapon skills, Martial Arts skill. These
  determine weapon (or mage staff) reward probabilities and armour weight if
  you happen to get an armour piece. Magic classes also have a somewhat higher
  chance to get a crown instead of helmet/cap.
  Note: Critical-strike skill will aim at sword-type weapons, same as if you
  skilled Sword-mastery skill.
  If you have Sword-mastery and Anti-magic skill, you will get a Dark Sword in
  case you receive a weapon as reward.
- wear roughly the appropriate type of armour (ie light vs heavy) and..
- wield the type of weapon (dual, 1-handed or 2-handed) that you prefer.
  This might affect three factors randomly: An actual weapon reward, whether or
  not you might gain a shield for reward, whether you might get light or heavy
  armour for reward. Keep in mind that there is still a random factor in what
  item you will actually get.
  Note that you will not receive a shield if you're dual-wielding or if your
  class is rogue.
  Regarding weapon weight, note that a weapon reward will usually not give you
  less attacks per round than the weapon you are already wielding (if any). If
  you don't wield one, it aims for 3 attacks per round as default.
- runemasters who receive a piece of armour will usually (as long as it's
  reasonably possible regarding ego-power type and value) get one that provides
  resistance to one of the elements they can conjure up with their runecraft
  skills. For this special feature any skill greater than zero in a particular
  rune element is sufficient, instead of the usual 3.000 threshold.
  Resistances your character already possesses do not become prerequisites for
  the item, so it will not end up redundant with Draconian resistances for
  example.
- druids will never receive a mage staff even if they haven't trained their
  Martial Arts skill above the starting value yet.

It does not matter if a skill is trained further above 3.000 or what your
character level is. Skills are used to 'unlock' item classes such as
'mage staff' or 'specific melee weapon' but for example you won't have a higher
chance to get a sword if you increase Sword-mastery to 5.000 than if you only
had it at the minimum threshold value of 3.000.

If you qualify for multiple reward classes, which are 'specific melee weapon',
'specific ranged weapon', 'mage staff', 'trap', the following priorities apply:
-A melee weapon chance will nullify a mage staff chance.
-A melee weapon vs ranged weapon will have about equal chance to get picked.
-A mage staff will have somewhat better chances vs a ranged weapon.
-Traps have about 75% chance to override any other reward class.
-Aside from the reward class picked, there is still about a 50% chance to
 receive an armour piece instead (even true for trap class).

Aside from these, randomness is always a factor so the result may vary.
The final quality of the item is therefore pretty random, except that certain
bad or very cheap item types or unfitting ego powers (depending on your
character) are banned.



(8.6) Alternative ruleset 'Ironman Server'
------------------------------------------
A server might be configured with a special ruleset called 'Ironman Server'
rules. Such a server will be listed on the meta server under
  "TomeNET Ironman ..."
instead of just
  "TomeNET ..."
and when you connect to it and enter the character overview
screen, at the bottom there will be a line reading
  "The server is running 'IRONMAN_SERVER' settings".

In general, Ironman rules are stricter than normal server configurations.

The differences between Ironman ruleset and normal servers are as follows:
  -Only one character is allowed per account.
  -All characters are no-ghost mode, so they have only 1 life (ie 'unworldly').
  -Usually, accounts expire slower (183 days instead of 62 days).
  -The Training Tower is empty, no monsters or items spawn in there
   (except for the Arena Monster Challenge event).
  -Certain extra stores may spawn in the dungeons
   ('Seasoned Tradesman', or specialized stores similar to town stores).
  -All dungeons are ironman (see (4.3)):
   -Bree's dungeon 'Barrow-Downs' is normal ironman,
   -other town dungeons allow recalling every 500 ft (10 floors),
   -non-town dungeons allow random recalling at a 20% chance per floor,
   -on dungeon levels shallower than level 20 (eg easier than -1000 ft Bree),
    recalling is impossible, overriding the above rules.
  -Players may recall INTO dungeons to 50 ft + every 1000 ft, eg to 50 ft,
   1050 ft, 2050 ft, ... .
  -Players start with more gold (class-dependant) to buy supplies.
  -Players additionally start with a few cure wounds potions.
  -Players get a message in chat when party members take a staircase.
  -If a party owner dies, someone else from the party is automatically promoted
   to party owner, so parties won't get disbanded easily, making party-diving
   more effective.
  -Mimicry users have a very slim chance of insta-learning a form!
   (Note that this also works 'in advance', ie while you have not yet the
   required mimicry skill to actually see the learn-message show up.)
  -Item level restrictions are disabled and have no effect.
  -Extermination orders can be acquired as early as at level 3 instead of level
   5 and the amount of monsters that needs to be slain is even somewhat lower.
  -Temporary luck bonus from deeds is somewhat longer.
  -Usually, scheduled artifact resets happen less frequently (if at all).
   (See (5.9b) for more information about artifact resets.)
  -Halloween event allows players up to 40 instead of 35,
   and the Great Pumpkin spawns on floors up to level 49 instead of 39.
  -Stealing from stores is possible right away instead of requiring a certain
   character level (usually 5 on normal servers).
  -Server settings that would usually turn items dropped/thrown by very low
   level characters to level 0 will be ignored, ie item level is kept.


(8.6a) Special server type 'Arcade Server'
------------------------------------------
*** Under very sporadic development -
    features might be incomplete/not working.
    To check the sourc code, look for ARCADE_SERVER definitions.
    The arcade server might not be running at all times but
    you could ask for it to be started when an admin is online. ***

Like 'Ironman Server' mentioned in the paragraph above, 'Arcade Server' is an
alternate ruleset, which is however *very* different from normal gameplay:

The Arcade Server was originally created and developed by Moltor. Later on
Kurzel also joined the project. It has nothing to do with normal dungeon
dwelling but instead features some hot action games that merely (ab)use the
TomeNET 'engine'. :)

Note: After logging in you may press '?' key for a help screen.
      The descriptions below are partially taken from that help file.


*******************************************************************************
 If you log on to an Arcade Server, your client will automatically attempt to
 load the required macro file to play, which is
  - 'arcade-win.prf' on Windows OS
  - 'arcade-x11.prf' on X11 (Linux/OSX)

 If your client is older than 4.5.3 you probably don't have these macros.
 In that case you can download them at the bottom of the downloads page on
 www.tomenet.eu and extract them to folder TomeNET/lib/user.
 But of course you should actually just update your whole client instead.
*******************************************************************************


On the Arcade server, you can play..


Smash'em
--------
Smash TV was a kickass arcade game from 1990, similar to Robotron. The player
is attacked from all sides by mostly-unarmed goons. The arcade version uses two
joysticks to allow you to run and fire in different directions. Unfortunately
tomenet doesn't support joystick input. Here you must use special macros to
shoot. For details press '?' in the game.

The Smash'em macros provide the following controls:

    F1              starts the game.
    F2              starts the game at level 4, skipping the early
                    levels if you feel that those are too easy.

    q,w,e           makes your character auto-fire in the according
    a, ,d            direction (y key works same as z key).
    z,x,c

    s               stops firing/bandages.

    ,               same as '<' key (ie go up one level).

    numpad          movement.

    Q               quit game.

    TAB             switch macro set from "Smash'em" to "Tron".


Tron
----
Like in the movie "Tron", a light cycle racing game where you leave a trail of
energy behind you forming a wall in which you and other competitors can crash
which results in their elimination.
Power-ups will randomly spawn and increase the trail length.
Up to four players can participate at once. For details press '?' in the game.

The Tron macros provide the following controls:

    F3              enter arena.
    F4              start game.

    F5              list options.

    F6              reduce game speed.
    F7              increase game speed.

    F9              reduce snake max length.
    F10             increase snake max length.

    F11             reduce amount of walls.
    F12             increase amount of walls.

    Arrow keys or   movement.
    numpad 2,4,6,8

    Q               quit game.

    TAB             switch macro set from "Tron" to "Smash'em".

Hit F4 as soon as at least two players have joined the areana via F3 key to
start the actual match.

To toggle an option, type "option" or "option on"/"option off" in chat.
Speed can be changed via "moar speed"/"less speed",
length can be changed via "moar length"/"less length",
walls can be changed via "moar walls"/"less walls".

(8.7) Game engine limits
------------------------
The TomeNET server, aka the "game engine", runs at 60 frames per second.
This imposes certain limits that can clash when your character exceeds certain
speed and attack numbers, if you are not on a relatively deep dungeon floor:

The deeper you go, the slower time passes (compare (4.14)). On the world
surface time passes the fastest: A turn for your character takes around 0.7
seconds in real time. (Vice versa, 1 second equals ~1.4 game turns there).

A character moving at the maximum possible speed of +90 (actually you can get
more speed, but it will only help to counter the slowdown your character might
experience from carrying a heavy backpack, it will not increase your speed any
further) is able to perform 8 actions per character turn. That means in Bree
(or in general on the world surface, it's all the same) that character could
perform 8 actions in 0.7 seconds. That is roughly 0.088 seconds per action.
This means that the game engine (running at 60 fps) has approximately 5.3
frames for performing each action.

Usually this is fine, because an action only takes one frame. With two notable
exceptions! Shooting with ranged weapons and the auto-retaliator for melee
weapons.
Those split up the single attacks (each strike/each shot) so that each of them
takes one frame, instead of all of them being performed in a single frame.
Since the aforementioned character at +90 speed in Bree only has 5 frames
available, that means he can only utilise 5 blows or shots at best. So if he
attacks a target dummy in Bree to measure his damage, he will get no further
damage increase for more blows/round than 5.

If he moves at +70 speed, he can already benefit from a 6th attack, at +50
speed from a 7th. Remember however, this limit is so "low" only because he is
at dungeon level 0 (Bree/world surface).


However, this problem is not that bad when you consider that time passes much
slower at deeper dungeon levels, giving the game engine more room to fit in all
the actions:

At floor level 85 or deeper (aka 4250ft), the slowdown caps (although there is
a special further slowdown for the Nether Realm). At level 84 (4200ft) time has
already been slowed down so much that a character at max speed ('Fast +90')
will benefit from 14 blows or shots per round, which is the maximum you can
benefit from at max speed.

This limit can only be reached by a dual-wielding warrior, other warriors will
only reach 13 bpr, which is reached at dungeon level 77 aka -3850ft.

If boosted by friendly spells mindboost, zeal and by berserk magic (or ability)
a dual-wielding warrior could reach 14 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 18 bpr. The maximum speed
for which this high bpr still makes sense (on dungeon level 4200ft and deeper)
is +55 speed. If you regularly get boosted by party members in this crazy way,
consider using accuracy/damage or critical-hits equipment instead of
extra-attacks items so you can increase your speed above 55 and still get full
benefit of the EA boosts.

Even at floor level 67 (the first Angband floor) a character of speed +90 (or
higher) could already utilise up to 11 attacks per round without dps loss, and
a character of speed +71 can even utilise up to 13 attacks per round! Again a
feat that hardly any character will be surpassing.

This means that although the game engine limits get exceeded when testing dps
on the target dummies in Bree with a character that moves at extreme speed and
uses either melee auto-retaliator or slings/bows/crossbows, there is basically
no problem at all when fighting monsters in the deeper dungeons.


If you want to compare dps of different weapons or the effect of extra-attack
equipment vs critical-hit equipment in Bree, first remove all items that give
+speed (and apply to both scenarios) to make sure you get accurate numbers.
The limits in Bree (and hence on the world surface) are:
 +90 speed -> max 5 attacks
 +72 speed -> max 6 attacks
 +53 speed -> max 7 attacks
 +43 speed -> max 8 attacks
 +37 speed -> max 9 attacks
 +32 speed -> max 10 attacks
 +28 speed -> max 11 attacks
 +25 speed -> max 12 attacks
 +22 speed -> max 13 attacks
 +20 speed -> max 14 attacks
 +18 speed -> max 15 attacks
 +11 speed -> max 20 attacks (the cap for blows per round, actually!)
In case you test this and find rounding errors, let me know! :-p

Likewise, if you want to compare speed vs critical hits, first remove all items
that give extra attacks and would apply to both scenarios.



(8.8) Troubleshooting
---------------------
Note: Some of these problems are deprecated and don't exist in this form or at
all anymore. Some messages might also vary slightly.
For trouble with lagging out or freezing up, see PROBLEM 25 and 28.

PROBLEM 00: I am behind a firewall. What ports do I need to open in order to
            play TomeNET?
SOLUTION:   If you want to connect directly to a specific server by specifying
            its address via command-line or config file, you only need to allow
            an outgoing TCP/IP connection to remote port 18348, that's the
            standard port servers run on. (If you'd like to play on the Ironman
            server, it's port 19348 instead of 18348. See (8.6) for more
            information about Ironman settings. For the Arcade server it's port
            20348, see (8.6a) for more information about Arcade server.)
            If you want to make use of the server list that appears when you
            don't specify a particular server, you additionally have to allow
            the game to connect to the meta server which provides the server
            list. For this, remote port 8801 TCP must also be opened.
            If you don't have access to the firewall, for example in school or
            at work, you can still try to set up an SSH tunnel or a socks
            proxy server (on either the firewall machine or your PC at home or
            any other PC outside. Ask google for info about how to do that).

PROBLEM 01: I don't get to see a server list when I start TomeNET.
            Instead, I am immediately asked for account and password.
SOLUTION:   This is a typical problem on Windows XP. There are 3
            possible fixes:
            -Use 'Win98 Compatibility Mode' (Create a link from TomeNET.exe,
             right-click it, choose 'properties', choose 'Compatibility'.
             This option is available natively on Windows XP systems; for
             Windows 2000 systems first try the other two points mentioned
             below, if they don't help, get the compatibility mode update
             from www.microsoft.com or from www.c-blue.de/appupd.exe ).
            -Move the 'TomeNET' directory to your drive's root. For
             example C:\TomeNET\.. .
            -Make sure the path name does not contain any spaces!
            -to edit your "TomeNET.ini" file and specify a host directly by
             specifying "HOST=europe.tomenet.eu".
             Or you can even give the IP address "HOST=37.187.75.24".

PROBLEM 02: I get to a server list, but it doesn't show any servers. It just
            says 'Press Q to enter a server manually' and that's it.
SOLUTION:   There are 2 possible solutions.
            -There is currently no public TomeNET server running. That can
             happen if a server update is currently being applied or if for
             some reason the server just crashed. Try again after a minute.
            -There are some DNS problems. These can happen for various reasons
             although they aren't very likely. DNS problems can last for a
             longer period of time though, being very annoying.
             That the server isn't listed doesn't mean that it's down though.
             You should try to connect manually (press 'Q') to either:
             europe.tomenet.eu
             or (if that doesn't work either) directly to its IP adress:
             37.187.75.24

PROBLEM 03: When I start TomeNET I don't see anything except a small hollow
            yellow rectangle (the cursor). All windows stay black. It seems
            that the cursor reacts to my inputs by printing out some black
            hence invisible text.
SOLUTION:   A rare problem that is not caused by TomeNET really, but usually
            happens on Windows XP and older:
            MS Windows sometimes keeps the TomeNET font file opened although
            the client has already been terminated. Next time you start TomeNET
            it will be unable to open its font files for that reason, resulting
            in the lack of any text on the screen.
            What to do is restart your MS Windows system and the text should be
            visible again. Instead of restarting you can also try just logging
            your Windows user account out and then back in right away.
            (This usually only happens once, after updating the client.)

PROBLEM 04: All windows _except for the main window_ stay empty.
SOLUTION:   First make sure it's really a bug and not just missing window
            settings: Press '=' key and 'w' key and configure your windows
            appropriately. It is vital to set one of the windows to display
            game and/or chat messages, so you can actually read what other
            players write, and also keep track of combat messages!
            When you're done setting up the windows, go to 'save options'
            (key 's').
            If all the windows are still blank, read on:
            Exact reasons are unknown but seem to only happen on MS Windows
            machines. Sometimes a simple reboot helps. If it doesn't, open
            TomeNET.ini file with a text editor, look for the window sections,
            change the fonts to the same settings (8x13) as in the
            [Main window] section: FontFile=8X13.FON , Font=8X13.FON .
            Also, you could adjust the width/height of the windows (to 80x24
            for example). Try other fonts too, maybe they work for you.

PROBLEM 05: I cannot browse (some) spell books, I see some LUA error messages
            if I try or when I connect to the server.
SOLUTION:   Your LUA script files are outdated. Those files are responsible
            for any spell-casting and some other things.
            To update them, you have 2 possibilities:
            -Automatic update: Join the server, you should see a message in
             the chat window, saying that (some of) your LUA files are being
             updated.
            -If for some reason auto-update doesn't work for you,
             download the latest client again.
            Note: There was a bug in client 4.4.8, preventing it from auto-
            updating LUA files, which was fixed in 4.4.8a and higher again.

PROBLEM 06: TomeNET seems to freeze up while playing. (Also see PROBLEM 25 and
            28, which offer different solutions for similar issues!)
SOLUTION:   This can happen if your latency is relatively high and many
            messages are transported between the server and your client.
            In fact it's just your display that freezes up. In that state
            you can for example type a chat message and other players
            will read it.
            Quit the game and join again to continue playing.
            Or just start another instance of the game and log in, that will
            override the old connection, making your client quit with
            "resume connection" message.

PROBLEM 07: I am disconnected during gameplay. (Note: If it seems to be a
            lag-out or freeze problem, also see PROBLEM 25 and 28!)
SOLUTION:   This can have several reasons. On disconnection a message box will
            appear, telling you about the problem. The following messages
            might occur:
            "client quit"
                    This just shows up if you regularly quit your client.
            "Committed suicide"
                    You just committed suicide..
            "resume connection"
                    This happens if you try to log in the same character with
                    two TomeNET clients at once, the older client will quit
                    and the client that just logged in will take over.
            "Killed by..."
                    Your character was finally killed/destroyed.
            "Starving auto-kick"
                    Your character was starving due to lack of food, and you
                    were not moving or performing any action for some time, so
                    the game assumed you were AFK and kicked your character out
                    to prevent it from starving to death without you noticing.
                    What you need to do: Log back in and eat something as soon
                    as possible.
            "Starving to death"
                    You died to starvation.
            "Timeout 08"
                    This happens if you 'lag out' on a slow connection or if
                    the server or your computer is under very heavy load.
            "Panic save failed"
                    This means the server just crashed and even failed to save
                    the characters :(. It will usually be back online after a
                    minute or earlier.
            "Panic save succeded"
                    This means the server just crashed :(. It will usually
                    be back online after a minute or earlier.
            "Server shutdown (save succeeded)"
                    The server was shut down regularly. It will usually be
                    back online after a minute or earlier.
            "Server shutdown (save failed!)"
                    The server was shut down regularly but saving the
                    characters failed for some reason (insufficient disk
                    space). It will usually be back online after a minute or
                    earlier.
            "banned for ..."
                    You were banned temporarily from the server (includes
                    being kicked out).
            "kicked out"
                    You were kicked out of the server.
            "read error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "write error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "flush error"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "receive error in play"
                    Can happen if you lag out or if packet loss occurs.
            "can't read on socket"
                    Can happen if your connection gets disrupted or overloaded.
                    May especially happen on not-so-great connections if you
                    die and the server tries to send a large bunch of death
                    dump information to your client. Note that in that case you
                    didn't die _because_ of this error, but the error occurred
                    _because_ you already died.
            "Server closed the connection"
                    Maybe a firewall or bad network problem.
            "No login reply received"
                    The login process couldn't be completed. Probably a network
                    problem, or really bad lag/timeout.

PROBLEM 08: I am disconnected from the server with an error message, this
            happens before I can even start playing.
SOLUTION:   Read the error message displayed in a message box on quitting.
            Here is a list of possible errors and solutions:
            "Your name is too long!"
                    Don't use names longer than 15 characters.
            "Your name contains control chars!"
                    Don't use control chars in your name.
            "No such character"
                    Your client tried to log in with a
                    non-existant character (shouldn't happen).
            "You are temporarily banned from connecting to this server!"
                    Self-explaining.
            "disconnect in login"
                    Don't take too long for your character
                    creation or you might time out.
            "login failure" or "can't read on socket"+"net input error" in the
            character overview screen:
                    A wrong account or password was entered.
            "Name already owned"
                    Account name already exists.
            "Your client is outdated. Please get the latest one from
            http://www.tomenet.eu/"
                    Download the latest client, see (0.1).
            "Server responds 'Unknown client version'. Server might
            be outdated or client is invalid. Latest client is at
            http://www.tomenet.eu/"
                    The server might be running an older
                    version than your client is.
            "Sorry, the game is full.  Try again later."
                    Wow the game is really full!
           "Your accountname, username or hostname contains invalid characters"
            (or just "Net input error")
                    Player characters are identified by 4 names:
                    -Character name
                    -Account name
                    -Username (The name they are logged on with on their PC)
                    -Hostname (The hostname of the connecting computer)
                    The hostname is not really important. However, make sure
                    that all of these names may only consist of letters,
                    numbers, spaces, and all other characters with an ASCII
                    code between 32 (SPACE) and 122 ('z').
                    The username and hostname must not be empty. The character
                    name needs to start with a letter ('A'..'Z' or 'a'..'z').
            "There is already another character from this user/machine on the
            server."
                    You tried to login with two characters from the same
                    account or machine simultaneously, which is usually
                    forbidden.
            "Sorry, the server is for members only.  Please retry with name
            'guest'."
                    Log in with 'guest'. You need to get an account for this
                    private server in order to play. Check the server's intro
                    screen for information about how to obtain an account.
            "That nick name is already in use. If it is your nickname, wait 30
            seconds and try again."
                    Happens if you get disconnected and then try to reconnect
                    from a different IP adress before your character timed out
                    (which takes approximately 20-30 seconds).
            ("Connection failed with status xx" (xx is an error code)
                    This message should never appear.)
            "That server either isn't up, or you mistyped the hostname."
                    The client was unable to connect to the server you
                    specified. If you are sure that you have entered the
                    correct IP adress or hostname, check your firewall (see
                    PROBLEM 00 for more information).
                    NOTE: Servers might be down temporarily when they are
                    updated. So make sure to try again after a few minutes.
                    If the server really seems to be down for a longer period
                    of time, us admins are probably not at home and you'll
                    have to wait for a bit, sorry. Such downtimes basically
                    never happen though.
            "Server didn't respond!"
                    The server is up, but something is awry. Wait for a few
                    minutes, there might be admins working on it at the
                    moment. Otherwise, visit the forum (see above).
            "Network verify failed!"
                    May happen if you specify a wrong password or try to
                    create an account which already exists.
                    Also happens (following a "No Verify Response") if your
                    connection to the server is *really* bad.
            If you get kicked out with an error message on the character
            overview screen (which seems to be empty), also see PROBLEM 14.

PROBLEM 09: I can't connect to the meta-server (the server that displays you
            a list of online TomeNET servers) or a specific TomeNET server.
            Instead my connection seems to time-out.
SOLUTION:   If you are behind a firewall make sure that the TCP ports
            8801 for metaserver and 18348 for the actual TomeNET server aren't
            blocked. (Well, the metaserver isn't needed to play - specify the
            game server via command-line or when asked for it after starting
            up the game then.)
            The meta server's hostname is "meta.tomenet.eu" and its IP is
            actually the same as the official game servers (37.187.75.24);
            In case there is a DNS problem somewhere in the internet you could
            just edit TomeNET.ini and replace the hostname by its actual IP.

PROBLEM 10: I'm not blocked by a firewall, but I still don't see the
            metaserver when I run Tomenet. Instead after waiting for a short
            period of time I'm asked to enter a server manually.
SOLUTION:   The meta-server might be down or a DNS problem might be occuring
            right now. This can happen from time to time. You don't need the
            meta-server to play TomeNET though.
            Just type in the hostname of the server you'd like to connect to,
            for official main server:   europe.tomenet.eu
            If the hostname doesn't work you can also try entering its IP
            address 37.187.75.24.
            Make sure your TomeNET.ini file contains the correct server port,
            usually 18348! This port isn't needed if you use the meta-list to
            choose a server to connect to, but it's important if you connect
            directly! (For linux the file is ".tomenetrc".)
            You can connect directly to a TomeNET server and skip the meta
            server list by running your Tomenet directly from the command-line
            (DOS window) within its folder, adding the server IP as a
            parameter. (In windows2k choose START/Run... and type 'cmd'
            without quotation marks to open a command-line window.
            Alternatively you can create a shortcut from your TomeNET.exe by
            right-clicking, dragging, releasing it. Edit this shortcut's
            properties and add the server IP to the command-line.)
            For official main server it would look like this:
            TomeNET.exe europe.tomenet.eu
            If the hostname doesn't work for whatever reason you may try the
            IP adress:
            TomeNET.exe 37.187.75.24

PROBLEM 11: The main window doesn't display the floor dots in town and in
            certain dungeons, like the Training Tower and Angband. Further,
            fields are sometimes not redrawn correctly, resulting in fake
            'trails'.
SOLUTION:   Seems to happen on MS Windows machines sometimes.
            Workaround (will slightly change the game's look, ie those dots):
            Edit /lib/user/font-win.prf and comment out the lines which end on
            the string '\31' (should be 2 lines at the beginning of the file,
            those labelled 'Floors' and 'Invis Traps').
            'Commenting out' means that you simply put a '#' symbol at the
            beginning of a line.

PROBLEM 12: Every time I connect to the server it will automatically download
            LUA script files. However, they will have a size of 0 Bytes.
SOLUTION:   Possibly write-protection on existing files or the folder.
            Workaround: Make sure you really have the latest LUA files in
            TomeNET's /lib/scpt folder (you can download them from
            http://www.tomenet.eu/ or our personal pages). Then set all LUA
            files in that directory to write-protected. This will prevent
            TomeNET from overwriting them with 0 Byte files.

PROBLEM 13: I seem to be able to login, create a new character or select a
            character, and see the message of the day (login screen).
            But right before the actual game starts I get a broken pipe / no
            packet reply error.
SOLUTION:   This might be caused by a misconfigured router (some D-Link models
            for example). Try to establish an SSH-tunnel from your PC behind
            the router to a machine outside of your LAN for port 18348 (TCP).
            (This might even reduce lag under certain circumstances.)

PROBLEM 14: I get kicked out with an error message after entering an account
            name and password.
SOLUTION:   It's most likely because that account name is already in use by
            someone else so your password was recognized as 'incorrect' since
            it was most likely different from that user's password. Just try a
            different account name.
            Likewise, if that account indeed belongs to you, you have probably
            made a typo while entering your password.

PROBLEM 15: The level completely changed while I was on it.
SOLUTION:   No real solution at this time, sorry. See (0.5) for more
            information about that problem. ('types of crashes')
            IMPORTANT: You should restart the client immediately and recall
            right after you logged back in, to avoid getting killed.

PROBLEM 16: I cannot see monster x although I can 'See Invisible'.
SOLUTION:   Some monsters have no appeareance and cannot be seen at all.

PROBLEM 17: After my character appears in the actual game, I receive an orange
            message saying "Receiving updated file ....", followed by a red
            message saying "No access to lib directory!".
SOLUTION:   The first message means, that one or more magic spells or prayers
            have been changed, and your client tries to automatically update
            its spell scripts to the latest version (LUA scripts in lib/scpt).
            Since this update didn't always work for everyone, and sometimes
            the scripts would be deleted instead of updated due to a bug, all
            spell scripts (LUA files) were set to be write-protected. This
            prevents accidental deletion, but also prevents auto-updating,
            which is indicated by the red error message!
            To solve this, you will have to delete the files within your
            /lib/scpt directory and replace them with the latest versions
            manually.
            If auto-download fails, download the latest client manually again.

PROBLEM 18: When I try to unpack the latest TomeNET ZIP file, I get strange
            messages telling of 'write-protected', 'read-only' or 'password-
            protected'. Afterwards, the client won't function properly.
SOLUTION:   Make sure that TomeNET is NOT running while you try to install the
            new version. If TomeNET is running, the unpacking will fail to
            overwrite the existing files! Shut down TomeNET, then extract the
            ZIP (overwriting everything), then start TomeNET again.

PROBLEM 19: On GNU/Linux OS, When someone uses the /page command to page me,
            I don't hear the three beeps.
SOLUTION A: You are probably using OSS. If your soundcard or soundchip doesn't
            support mixing of multiple sources, that means only one program at
            a time can output sound. In that case, do the following:
            Make sure all your programs, like media players, instant
            messengers, system setting tools, etc. are set to use 'ALSA' for
            sound, not OSS. Now that all programs use ALSA, make Tomenet use
            ALSA too. You can do that by using an "ALSA wrapper" which takes
            the OSS sound output of any application that doesn't support ALSA
            natively, and wraps it to ALSA. The ALSA wrapper is called 'aoss'.
            After installing 'aoss', just use call it with the OSS application
            as parameter. Example:    $> aoss ./tomenet
            Another example (to start the Opera webbrowser):    $> aoss opera
SOLUTION B: If you are using X11, this problem may occur depending on your
            terminal configuration. You can try to change your configuration,
            or you can press '=' key to go to Audio Options and enable
            'Use audio system for paging sounds'. This will result in paging
            sounds being played via your sound card, instead of the operating
            system's beep (requires TomeNET v4.4.5 or higher).
            (See (2.1a) for more information about the audio system.)

PROBLEM 20: Are 'ToME' and 'TomeNET' similar?
SOLUTION:   Despite similar name, the only thing these two games have in common
            is that they are both middle-earth themed, and some visuals might
            also be similar.
            Other than that, the two games are quite different in most aspects!
            In other words: TomeNET is definitely not 'multi-player ToME'.
            Also, the two games are maintained and developed by completely
            different persons and teams.

PROBLEM 21: My (mixer) settings or window positions (MS Windows only) aren't
            saved automatically as they should be, when I quit the game.
SOLUTION:   Don't use ALT+F4 or the 'x' button in the title bar of the game
            window to quit the game. It will result in skipping the normal exit
            routine, which asks you to save chat and which also saves certain
            settings. Instead, use CTRL+Q for 'save & quit' (compare (0.2)).

PROBLEM 22: When I try to login, I get a 'security violation'.
SOLUTION:   Either your host name (that's your PC's network name you can set in
            the Windows network settings) or network user name (usually same
            you use to login with, UNIX-style) is empty, or your TomeNET
            account name starts with an invalid character (must be A..Z).
            Another possibility is that you are already logged in, and are now
            trying to log in again from a different IP address. Resuming a
            connection is possible, but must be done from the same IP address.

PROBLEM 23: I just quit the game, and tried to log in again with another
            character of mine, but I get an error message saying
            "Multiple logins on the same account aren't allowed".
SOLUTION:   When you quit the game while you are still inside a dungeon or a
            tower or on the world surface but not within a town or housing area
            around a town, your character will stay in the game for around
            20..30 more seconds.
            This prevents cheating by just quitting when a dangerous situation
            occurs in gameplay.
            During this time, if you try to login again, you can only use the
            same character that is now sitting out the timeout, thereby
            resuming your gameplay.
            You cannot log in with any other character until the timeout of
            20..30 seconds is over and your old character has finally been
            taken offline by the server.
            In general, you should avoid quitting the game outside of towns,
            since it can put you in danger. Not only because your character
            will stay in the game for a little while after you quit, but also
            because you can't be sure what the situation around you will be
            the next time you log on again!

PROBLEM 24: When trying to macro F-keys, they don't seem to work properly.
            Especially, when hitting F1, a window about MS Windows Help/Support
            pops up instead.
SOLUTION:   When playing on a notebook, check the state of the 'Fn' special
            shift key, and toggle it accordingly.

PROBLEM 25: The connection is surprisingly laggy. (Also see PROBLEM 28!)
SOLUTION:   -If you're on Wifi (WLAN) plug in an ethernet cable instead!
            Wireless LAN connections can be pretty unreliable and cause
            periodic lag from trying to re-scan for available networks.
            Alternatively you can try to configure your WLAN not to do that,
            however, WLAN can still be pretty prone to lag sometimes.
            -Test it on another PC on the same internet connection.
            -Test it on a friend's internet connection.
            -Check if it only happens on certain in-game actions you perform.
            -Check if it only happens at a certain time of the day.
            -Make sure you don't have downloads or uploads running in the
            background.

PROBLEM 26: I resized some TomeNET windows by dragging them with the mouse,
            but it seems it doesn't have the desired effect.
SOLUTION:   After having resized windows via mouse, restart the game once
            by exiting with CTRL+Q key.

PROBLEM 27: While I am creating a new character, I got disconnected with a
            "Timeout 04" error message.
SOLUTION:   You have about 20 minutes to complete the character creation
            process. If you exceed this time, you will timeout and get
            disconnected.

PROBLEM 28: If I or other players nearby fire a lot of arrows or cast a lot
            of spells, my client lags or freezes somewhat.
            Could also happen when taking staircases or when there are a lot of
            monsters on the screen.
SOLUTION:   Try to reduce or even disable flush-waits, by toggling the client
            options 'thin_down_flush' and if that's not enough also
            'disable_flush'. For details about these, see (2.3).

PROBLEM 29: I accidenally closed one of the sub-windows and now it's gone.
            How do I get it back?
SOLUTION:   Closing a sub-window sets it to 'invisible'. To change that, there
            are two ways:
            1) in game: Press = and then f for the window flags menu, select
            the affected window and press 'v' to toggle its visibility. You
            will need to restart the game for the change to take effect.
            2) close TomeNET first, then edit the file 'TomeNET.ini' which is
            located in your TomeNET folder with any text editor, locate the
            particular window, and you'll see a line saying "Visibility=0".
            Change the 0 to 1. Have a look at the X and Y coordinate of the
            same window too and make sure they aren't negative. If they are,
            just set them to 0. Save the ini file when you are done and start
            TomeNET again.

PROBLEM 30: Changes I do to my macros seem to not get saved or macros I deleted
            seem to still be there or client options I configured seem to reset
            to their previous values although I saved the macros/options to
            their respective .prf file.
SOLUTION:   Macros or client options can be saved to various .prf files which
            might _all_ get loaded automatically and partially override each
            other. So check _all_ (except for font*.prf and graf*.prf usually)
            .prf files in your lib/user folder and/or move or delete them to
            make sure they don't get loaded if you don't intend them to.
            For example the file 'user.prf' usually carries your client options
            and overrides the default file 'options.prf'. However, if there's a
            file 'user-x11.prf' (system-specific for Linux X11 - on Windows
            systems it'd be 'user-win.prf' accordingly) that one in turn will
            override settings in user.prf.
            An example regarding macro files: Let's say your character's name
            is 'Gandalf' and you saved your macros to 'Gandalf.prf' faithfully.
            However, since Gandalf is a human warrior, the client will also
            automatically load the files called 'Human.prf' and 'Warrior.prf'
            if those exist and also try to load a .prf file named like your
            account name.

PROBLEM 31: After logging on, the file 'audio.lua' was updated automatically.
            Now the wrong sound effects seem to be played for game events.
SOLUTION:   Just log out and back in, and your sound should be fine again.
            This typically happens if 'audio.lua' was updated.
            On a side note: Also check if maybe the sound pack was updated too,
            so you can redownload it and not miss out on newly added sound
            effects. Usually an update to file 'audio.lua' means that the sound
            pack has also been updated indeed.

PROBLEM 32: When trying to extract a music or sound pack to my xtra folder in
            order to install it, I get an error message or it doesn't seem to
            work correctly.
SOLUTION:   See (2.1a) for details on how to install audio packs. Also note
            that some people have reported that the program 'WinRAR' seems to
            cause problems in some cases, giving them "file corrupted" errors.
            A powerful free and open source program that is guaranteed to work
            is '7zip' (a sourceforge project at the time of writing)
            downloadable at:  http://www.7-zip.org/

PROBLEM 33: On OSX when entering the game (right after picking a character) in
            big_map mode with already large (46 lines) main window, the window
            will suddenly become small (24 lines) again.
            As of the time of writing this, the exact cause is still unknown.
            A workaround is to perform the following steps:
            -turn off big_map mode (= key for options, page 5) and save options
            -exit client with CTRL+Q (so it will save the main window height)
            -log on again, turn on big_map mode, save the options again.
            -from now on, always exit the game via the window close button in
             the window's titlebar, never via CTRL+Q. That way, your .tomenetrc
             config file is never overwritten and hence your client will always
             start with only 24 lines, switching back to correct big_map mode
             only when you actually log in with a character, thus circumventing
             the bug.

PROBLEM 34: On certain terminal emulators, TomeNET when run in ncurses-mode
            ('-c' command-line option or just a GCU-only client) will display
            wrong colours. This used to happen on Xfce4's 'Terminal' up till
            TomeNET version 4.5.0 (but didn't happen on xterm).
SOLUTION:   Since TomeNET 4.5.0a a hack has been added to work with Xfce4's
            'Terminal' terminal emulator.
            On other terminals where colours aren't correct, try exporting
            the TERM environment variable with the value "xterm16-color".
            For example run tomenet with this command (assumed you're inside
            the same folder as the executable binary 'tomenet'):
              TERM=xterm-16color ./tomenet -c
            Or export it first:
              export TERM=xterm-16color
              ./tomenet -c
            You can also try xterm-256color instead of xterm-16color.

PROBLEM 35: When running the client in terminal-mode, messages like
            "ALSA lib pcm.c...:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred"
            pop up, but the sound/music actually works ok.
            How to get rid of the messages?
SOLUTION:   Either tweak your sound settings (buffer size etc.) so ALSA doesn't
            get underruns anymore, or, if the audio actually sounds ok, you can
            suppress the messages by starting TomeNET with '-e' option, for
            example:
              ./tomenet -c -e
            This will redirect all messages which usually are sent to stderr
            to a log file "tomenet.log" instead, which will be created in your
            TomeNET folder.
            Alternatively, you can just redirect all error out put to /dev/null
            to completely discard it:
              ./tomenet -c 2>/dev/null

PROBLEM 36: Can I made the game windows larger?
SOLUTION:   You can resize windows that hold messages (chat and/or game
            messages) simply by dragging the lower edge down/upwards with your
            mouse. This also works for the main window, but this one will not
            remember its new size unless you also save your client options
            after you resized it (press '=' and then 's' to save those).
            Alternatively, you can edit the TomeNET.ini file (on Windows) or
            the .tomenetrc file (on Linux or OSX) and change the amount of
            lines for each window manually.
            Other than that, you can also increase the font size (that is the
            text size) in TomeNET: Either press '=' key and then cycle through
            pre-defined font sizes by tapping 'f' key, or again you can edit
            the TomeNET.ini file (Windows) or .tomenetrc file (Linux/OSX) to
            set fonts manually for each game window.
            Well, and you could change your actual screen resolution of course.

PROBLEM 37: When I join the server I get spammed with violet LUA error messages
            and also it will say in orange/dark-green that my LUA files are
            getting updated.
SOLUTION:   This happens when your LUA files are quite outdated.
            Just wait until the lua update has completed, you see that it has
            when you get a light green message saying "Reinitializing Lua".
            When that happened, quit and rejoin the server, the LUA errors
            should no longer happen now.

PROBLEM 38: I want to edit my TomeNET.ini file to enter name and password, so I
            don't have to type it in everytime I log on. But I don't see this
            file in my 'TomeNET' folder.
SOLUTION:   Windows by default hides the extension of most files, this means
            that the ".ini" part is invisible.
            Three ways around this:
            1) In file explorer, go to 'folder options' (usually in the Extras
               menu) and turn off hiding known file extensions.
            2) Right-click on a small (3kB) plain-looking file named 'TomeNET'
               in your TomeNET folder, and choose 'edit' (pick notepad.exe for
               editing, if asked). This file is most likely TomeNET.ini with
               its extension being hidden.
            3) Open an editor (for example notepad) and go to menu File->Open
               and browse to your TomeNET folder, and then type in
               'tomenet.ini' to have notepad open it.

PROBLEM 39: I run the Windows client on Wine, and when I resize the main window
            it doesn't resize properly or its contents aren't resized properly.
SOLUTION:   You need at least Wine 1.5.20 for this to work properly.
            (That Wine got a bugfix for correctly dispatching WM_EXITSIZEMOVE).

PROBLEM 40: I see black floor tiles that seem buggy. They can't be lit or they
            'smear' if other things pass over them.
SOLUTION:   In a file explorer, navigate into the folder 'TomeNET/lib/user'
            and delete the file 'font-win.prf' in there.

PROBLEM 41: Keyboard input on KDE/Linux is strangely laggy.
SOLUTION:   This is a weird one, but what has worked is to use smaller text
            fonts (at most 9X14).

PROBLEM 42: Aww, the ego power "Holy Avenger" that I'm so fond of does not
            exist in TomeNET anymore.
SOLUTION:   It does. It has just been renamed to "Aman", it does the same (and
            a little bit more even) as (Holy Avenger) items in other variants.

PROBLEM 43: When trying to connect to the meta server I get an error message:
            "No setup info received" and the game terminates.
SOLUTION:   This can happen on really bad/slow internet connections such as via
            mobile modems operating on arbitrarily (by the ISP) reduced
            bandwidth. There is no solution really, except retrying a few times
            until your connection attempt eventually "gets through". Make sure
            that no downloads or other bandwidth-using applications are running
            in parallel to increase your chances of successfully establishing a
            connection.

PROBLEM 44: The dark blue colour is too dark on my screen to be readable.
SOLUTION:   Edit your config file (TomeNET.ini on Windows, .tomenetrc on Linux
            and OSX) and find the line 'lighterDarkBlue'. In TomeNET.ini set it
            to 1 instead of 0, in .tomenetrc uncomment the line by removing the
            leading '#' symbol. Restart your game client.

PROBLEM 45: Sound sound effects, mostly the page sound (when someone pages you
            with the /page command) sounds oddly distorted.
SOLUTION:   Make sure that you don't have all four volume sliders at maximum:
            Just lower the master slider by 1 or 2 steps.

PROBLEM 46: Testing your character's damage-per-second (dps) on the target
            dummies in Bree with melee weapons or ranged weapons (slings, bows
            or crossbows) has weird effects: You don't get more damage from
            increasing your number of attacks per round, even though all other
            stats (speed, critical hits) are exactly the same.
            Or you actually seem to get a sharp increase in damage by bumping
            into the target dummy instead of using the melee auto-retaliator.
SOLUTION:   You are experiencing game engine limits regarding the world surface
            (including all towns, like Bree). See (8.7) for details.

PROBLEM 47: The TomeNET-Updater for Windows gives a message about captcha when
            I try to update sound pack or music pack.
SOLUTION:   Unfortunately the updater cannot defeat captchas of one-click
            hosters from where the audio packs are downloaded.
            This means that you just have to retry after some time has passed,
            for example an hour, and hope that you won't get a captcha request
            then.
            (In general, captcha requests tend to pop up when the file is very
            frequently accessed.)

PROBLEM 48: On Linux/X11 I get 100% cpu usage unless I disable audio (with the
            '-q' command-line option). This usually happens with more special
            audio hardware.
SOLUTION:   Change the audio sample rate in '.tomenetrc' config file to match
            your audio hardware's native sample rate. Most on-board sound chips
            use 48000 aka 48kHz, but if you encounter this problem you probably
            use a more sophisticated system that might run at higher rates such
            as 96000 aka 96kHz.

PROBLEM 49: On Linux/X11 I get 100% cpu usage when switching workspace away
            from TomeNET when I have 'recall_flicker' option enabled.
            (The system on which this happened had AMD graphics drivers, but
            that might not be relevant.)
SOLUTION:   This is suspected to be a problem with 'Awesome' window manager.
            However, if you use Gnome, starting Awesome through
              gnome-session --session=awesome
            has been reported to solve the problem.

PROBLEM 50: I get an antivirus warning when I try to run the installer version
            of TomeNET (the self-installing '.exe' file) or in general for the
            'install_tomenet' executable/process.
            Installation also fails or fails partially.
SOLUTION:   Avast and Trendmicro antivirus are known for causing trouble with
            the Nullsoft NSIS installer system that TomeNET utilises.
            Disable the antivirus program before you install TomeNET.
            Also, some scanners like virustotal.com will detect 'killproc'
            heuristics in the install_tomenet.exe helper process - which makes
            sense since this installer indeed will attempt to kill any running
            TomeNET process before it updates, this is the intended behaviour.

PROBLEM 51: On Windows 10 (maybe 8 too), the self-installer freezes on startup.
SOLUTION:   Why are you STILL using Windows.. Ok well, you can try to just sit
            it out, some people have reported that the NSIS installer is known
            to freeze for about 15 minutes on Windows 10. Maybe it will just
            continue if you wait for a while.

PROBLEM 52: Windows OS: Using the 'Alt' modifier key in macros doesn't work.
SOLUTION:   None. Install Linux in addition to Windows (dual-boot).

PROBLEM 53: I cannot select a server from the meta server list, it seems my key
            presses get ignored.
SOLUTION:   If you are using a non-english keyboard layout with asian or
            cyrillic letters, switch it to english layout.

PROBLEM 54: Editing config files of all kinds (ini/prf/opt/ins..) doesn't seem
            to have any effect.
SOLUTION:   If you're on Windows and using a game version greater than 4.6.1a,
            TomeNET will make copies of your 'scpt' and 'user' folders and work
            with those instead of the original ones (which are probably in your
            Program Files folder). The working copies are located at folder:
            C:\users\yourname\
            The drive letter and path could vary depending on your Windows
            installation, but this is the normal location in almost all cases.
            (The reason the game does this is that Windows starting at version
            7 will severly limit access to the Program Files folder.)
