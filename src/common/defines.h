/* File: defines.h */

/* Purpose: global constants and macro definitions */


/*
 * Do not edit this file unless you know *exactly* what you are doing.
 *
 * Some of the values in this file were chosen to preserve game balance,
 * while others are hard-coded based on the format of old save-files, the
 * definition of arrays in various places, mathematical properties, fast
 * computation, storage limits, or the format of external text files.
 *
 * Changing some of these values will induce crashes or memory errors or
 * savefile mis-reads.  Most of the comments in this file are meant as
 * reminders, not complete descriptions, and even a complete knowledge
 * of the source may not be sufficient to fully understand the effects
 * of changing certain definitions.
 *
 * Lastly, note that the code does not always use the symbolic constants
 * below, and sometimes uses various hard-coded values that may not even
 * be defined in this file, but which may be related to definitions here.
 * This is of course bad programming practice, but nobody is perfect...
 *
 * For example, there are MANY things that depend on the screen being
 * 80x24, with the top line used for messages, the bottom line being
 * used for status, and exactly 22 lines used to show the dungeon.
 * Just because your screen can hold 46 lines does not mean that the
 * game will work if you try to use 44 lines to show the dungeon.
 *
 * You have been warned.
 *
 * Edit: Added arbitrary screen sizes; for now just implemented up to 44 map
 *       lines aka 46 main window lines. (v4.4.9.1.0.2) - C. Blue

/*
 * The values for the "tval" field of various objects.
 *
 * This value is the primary means by which items are sorted in the
 * player inventory, followed by "sval" and "cost".
 *
 * Note that a "BOW" with tval = 19 and sval S = 10*N+P takes a missile
 * weapon with tval = 16+N, and does (xP) damage when so combined.  This
 * fact is not actually used in the source, but it kind of interesting.
 *
 * Note that as of 2.7.8, the "item flags" apply to all items, though
 * only armor and weapons and a few other items use any of these flags.

 * flags for powerful Bows, and flags which affect the player in a "general"
 * way (LITE, TELEPATHY, SEE_INVIS, SLOW_DIGEST, REGEN, FEATHER), including
