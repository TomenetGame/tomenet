  Thats to prevent cheezing

- Server bugfix, object description string was too small [80] for including
  the fake artifact inscriptions. I made every instance [160]. This will
  never be necessary, certainly not in all cases, but efficiency may be
  worked upon later.

28/09/2001

  Common symptom, the player list appears on game screen.

  directly bypassing meta server (previously this only worked for Unix clients)
- Multiple colors for different types of messages in recall window 
  (death, kill, private messages, etc.)

  for review after a long fight or long AFK

- Colour messaging added - should work with all message types.

01/10/2001
- Golem following/guard bug fixed. Golem will now follow down/up
  stairs regardless of guard.
- Other bugs identified (unfixed) Target friendly with golem causes
  chaos. The golem attacks nearest player, kills then homes in on the ghost.
  Also, swapping places with the golem causes problems. (Urgent fix)

02/10/2001
- Object ownership made invalid now after player ghost death. It was
  recycling ownership. It is set to MAX_ID+1.
- Annoying level 1 suicides are no longer shown.
